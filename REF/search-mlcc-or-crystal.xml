    Hilger Crystals Ltd (Hilger) manufactures a range of synthetic crystals&#xD;
      for X-ray and Infra-red applications. The collaboration between Hilger and&#xD;
      the School of Physical Sciences (SPS) dates back more than 10 years and&#xD;
      builds on the expertise of Prof. Chadwick and Dr Mountjoy in defect&#xD;
      chemistry and analysis of their local structure using XAFS measurements&#xD;
      [2,3]. The latest KTP project [4] (co-ordinated by Dr. Alfredsson)&#xD;
      followed a CASE-studentship between Prof. Chadwick and Hilger (Drs.&#xD;
      Telfer, Hutton and Blacklocks). This is an on-going collaboration and&#xD;
      further results are to be expected.&#xD;
    The new growth method stemming from SPS's collaboration with Hilger is&#xD;
      robust for producing moderate volumes of low afterglow (Tl,Cs)I in&#xD;
      relatively low capital cost plant, permitting Hilger to be competitive&#xD;
      with low cost manufacturers in China etc. Only a few crystal growers&#xD;
      worldwide have been able to achieve this and it has given the company a&#xD;
      competitive advantage. This has allowed Hilger to expand its market and&#xD;
      seek customers in high-end applications of X-ray imaging such as air&#xD;
      transport and sea cargo screening and medical diagnostic devices.&#xD;
    Despite the disadvantages detailed above the rare-earth doped crystals&#xD;
      are also of interest for some specialist applications.&#xD;
    As a result of the new product, derived from the collaboration with the&#xD;
      University, the company has recruited new staff, including one new&#xD;
      research scientist as well as other high-quality technical staff &amp;#8212; a key&#xD;
      requirement for future growth.&#xD;
    The new material enables great market penetration for high-performance&#xD;
      end sales to X-ray imaging companies throughout the world. All of the&#xD;
      company's current customers are located outside the UK. Hence, all sales&#xD;
      are export sales, mostly to the USA. The new material increased the annual&#xD;
      sales turnover by c.&amp;#163;45k the first year it was launched in 2012 and is&#xD;
      projected (based on past experience, by the company) to improve the annual&#xD;
      sales turnover in the next three years' time to &amp;#163;250k, which corresponds&#xD;
      to about 35% of the company's annual export volume.&#xD;

    &#xD;
    A positive effect on the reputation and advertisement of Hilger Crystals&#xD;
      Ltd, resulted in the company being acquired by one of their largest&#xD;
      competitors in 2010, becoming a partner of the Dynasil group, which&#xD;
      specialises in advanced materials for a broad range of applications, with&#xD;
      markets in the medical, industrial, defence, as well as the homeland&#xD;
      security, sectors. This occurred while the product described in this case&#xD;
      study was under development and hence the potential future profits from&#xD;
      this product will have contributed to Hilger's attractiveness to Dynasil.&#xD;
    Hilger Crystals grow crystals for other companies to use in x-ray&#xD;
      scanners and other devices. These are sold into, and employed in, the&#xD;
      security and medical industries. Hence societal impact is "downstream" and&#xD;
      we can only describe this aspect of the impact in general terms.&#xD;
    Principal Impact&#xD;
    &#xD;
      A new product has successfully been developed with a low afterglow&#xD;
        that exceeded original expectations.&#xD;
      While the new crystals only became available for sale in 2012, Hilger&#xD;
        already has four client companies which have purchased the crystals and,&#xD;
        thereby, have been able to manufacture and sell cheaper scanners that&#xD;
        yield higher quality images.&#xD;
      Hilger's managing director informed the University that currently&#xD;
        (June 2013) there are about 50 detectors using these crystals in use in&#xD;
        security and medical diagnostic roles.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Subsidiary Impact&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Indirectly this work contributes to improved security at national&#xD;
        entry points.&#xD;
      This work contributes to improved medical diagnostics (particularly&#xD;
        mammography).&#xD;
      The product is currently around 7%, and projected to reach 35%, of the&#xD;
        company's sales.&#xD;
      As all of the company's current customers are located outside the UK,&#xD;
        all sales are export sales and hence it produces income and tax revenue&#xD;
        to the UK.&#xD;
      Current customers have been retained, and new customers secured, by&#xD;
        the company.&#xD;
      New staff has been hired, including a research scientist and high&#xD;
        quality technical staff to expand the company's research base.&#xD;
      Exclusion of rare-earth dopants makes the material less expensive than&#xD;
        the originally proposed product.&#xD;
      In 2010 Hilger was incorporated into the Dynasil group, based in the&#xD;
        USA, improving the company's research profile with the aim to develop&#xD;
        new X-ray imaging materials.&#xD;
      A number of academic-related benefits including: (i) Hilger acting as&#xD;
        industrial partners in the EU-funded Interreg projects and (ii) SPS is&#xD;
        organising the international meeting EURODIM2014. The collaboration with&#xD;
        Hilger is assisting the University in attracting world-leading speakers&#xD;
        from industrial and academic backgrounds.&#xD;
      Generated research income to the University of Kent: (directly)&#xD;
        &amp;#163;150,000 and (indirectly) &amp;#163;300,000-&amp;#163;350,000.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    X-ray scanners are a staple of the security industry: their use at ports&#xD;
      and airports is a key component of national security. In order to function&#xD;
      effectively, these scanners require state-of-the- art scintillator&#xD;
      materials and, given the size of the global market and importance of the&#xD;
      industry, there is a drive to make these materials work more effectively&#xD;
      to achieve better clarity in object identification and faster scanning&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
    This case study describes the development of a new scintillator product&#xD;
      for Hilger Crystals Ltd which was based on a long-term collaboration with&#xD;
      materials researchers at the University of Kent. This represents a&#xD;
      substantial contribution to: improving security at country entry/exit&#xD;
      points; the commercial success of Hilger and the company's ability to&#xD;
      enter new markets (for example medical diagnostic uses). In addition to&#xD;
      the downstream security and diagnostic impact arising from this work there&#xD;
      have been a number of concomitant benefits to the country, the company and&#xD;
      the University.&#xD;

    An on-going collaboration between Hilger Crystals and physicists/chemists&#xD;
      in the School of Physical Sciences at the University of Kent (principally&#xD;
      A.V. Chadwick [Kent 1970-present] and G. Mountjoy [Kent 1996-present] and&#xD;
      later Alfredsson [Kent 2007-present] and Ph.D/KTP Associate A Blacklocks&#xD;
      [Kent 2004-2011]) has been in existence for more than a decade. This case&#xD;
      study describes one successful project that has arisen from this&#xD;
      collaboration. Not all of the research described here was published in the&#xD;
      academic literature for reasons of confidentiality. Publication [1] is&#xD;
      directly relevant to this proposal, Publications [2,3] describe&#xD;
      underpinning technique development pioneered by Kent staff, that was later&#xD;
      employed in this case. Theoretical work performed by Kent staff (M.&#xD;
      Alfredsson [Kent lecturer 2007-present]) was also key to the success of&#xD;
      this project. The SPS contribution can be verified by Hilger Crystals&#xD;
      [5.1].&#xD;
    There is a large worldwide market in scintillator materials for X-ray&#xD;
      scanners. However, images produced during scanning are blurred due to an&#xD;
      electronic process known as `afterglow'. Understanding the origin of the&#xD;
      afterglow in scintillators allows for the production of novel materials&#xD;
      with improved properties, resulting in sharper images.&#xD;
    The objectives of the collaboration between Hilger Crystals Ltd (Hilger)&#xD;
      and the School of Physical Sciences (SPS) were to:&#xD;
    (i) establish the origin of the afterglow process in Thallium-doped&#xD;
      Caesium Iodide (Tl,Cs)I scintillator single crystals;&#xD;
    (ii) develop an industrial process in which high-quality crystals could&#xD;
      be grown reliably, with significantly reduced afterglow, using standard&#xD;
      commercial materials;&#xD;
    (iii) investigate co-doping with rare-earth elements[1] to establish&#xD;
      whether these elements are critical for the afterglow reduction in&#xD;
      (Tl,Cs)I.&#xD;
    (i) Origin of the afterglow process.&#xD;
    It is generally accepted that the afterglow is caused by trapping of the&#xD;
      carriers that re-combine with the excited defect centres. The theoretical&#xD;
      work led by Alfredsson proposed unusual behaviour of the Cs-I interactions&#xD;
      in the system. Contrary to the general observation that band gaps decrease&#xD;
      with increasing pressure it was found that the band gap in CsI increases&#xD;
      if pressure or stress is applied. This was originally explained as a&#xD;
      relativistic effect in the material, but our simulations showed this be a&#xD;
      hybridisation effect. The observation is important in the understanding of&#xD;
      the origin to the afterglow, as the relaxation time of the material is&#xD;
      crucial for low afterglow. Thallium doping reduces the band gap&#xD;
      significantly, but the band gap behaviour remains. Understanding and&#xD;
      controlling this behaviour decreases the afterglow in the material&#xD;
    (ii) Reliable growth of high quality crystals.&#xD;
    New scaled-up crystal growth techniques were investigated at Hilger.&#xD;
      These were performed in collaboration with, and guided by Density&#xD;
      Functional Theory simulations and a number of material characterisation&#xD;
      experiments (e.g. IR, TGA, XRD and SEM-EDX) undertaken at SPS. The&#xD;
      quality of the crystal was found to be critically dependent on crystal&#xD;
      growth parameters, particularly temperature gradient and soaking times:&#xD;
      these were optimised. Processing of the final material, including heat&#xD;
      treatment and storage time, were found to reduce the afterglow, as the&#xD;
      material is allowed to relax after processing. Allowing the material to&#xD;
      relax means storage costs for the company. The result was a new crystal&#xD;
      growth method that yields new types of (TlCs)I crystals with substantially&#xD;
      fewer defects. These crystals are much clearer and more reproducible than&#xD;
      previously, and have dramatically reduced afterglow.&#xD;
    (iii) Co-doping with rare-earth elements.&#xD;
    Rare-earth doped CsI single crystals were initially grown at the SPS and&#xD;
      Hilger. In 2006 Blacklocks (Ph.D) and Chadwick[1] measured the afterglow&#xD;
      using X-ray excitation using combined techniques developed by Chadwick,&#xD;
      Mountjoy and others [2,3]. Short- and long-life relaxations times were&#xD;
      monitored for crystals with and without the presence of Eu and Sm. It was&#xD;
      found that there are two distinct afterglows, long-term and short-term and&#xD;
      that doping by rare-earths is only effective for short-term afterglow&#xD;
      reduction. Further, different growth conditions were explored. It had been&#xD;
      proposed that Tl is a determining factor controlling the afterglow in CsI&#xD;
      as this element may form Tl-dimers or defects in the structure. For this&#xD;
      purpose the local structure of CsI(Tl) structure was determined using&#xD;
      X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) [1-3] in combination with atomistic&#xD;
      simulations [unpublished, performed by M. Alfredsson and A. Blacklocks].&#xD;
      The introduction of rare-earth dopants decreases afterglow substantially,&#xD;
      but other properties such as hydroscopicity increase, limiting the range&#xD;
      of applications.&#xD;

Most&#xD;      recently (2009), NIBEC and AVX commenced a large scale project to improve&#xD;      the quality of the dielectric layers in the Multi-Layer Ceramic Capacitors&#xD;      (MLCC) that the company produce in millions of units per day. This project&#xD;      was highly successful with major improvements in nanoparticle dispersion&#xD;      which the company have now fully integrated by into their volume&#xD;      production lines (including Czech Republic). This has had a major impact&#xD;      upon product development and business results [4]. [text removed for&#xD;      publication]. Building on the success of this collaboration, in 2012 AVX&#xD;      co-funded a second project in collaboration with NIBEC specifically&#xD;      focusing on improvement of the base metal electrode (BME) system utilising&#xD;      nanoparticle nickel for MLCCs. This project has already identified&#xD;      improvements in BME ink formulation and processing. [text removed for&#xD;      publication]. This has arisen due to the direction and outputs achieved&#xD;      from the materials characterisation and the understanding associated with&#xD;      electrical characterisation of both raw materials and devices. Improved&#xD;      control of de-agglomeration and dispersion of barium titanate powders and&#xD;      metal oxide dopants along with feedback from nanoscale measurement and&#xD;      characterisation data (impedance analysis, dispersion and binder-particle&#xD;      interaction) have allowed the company to greatly enhance their&#xD;      manufacturing processes [1, 4]. A third and much larger project (&amp;#163;4m) has&#xD;      recently been submitted to Invest NI (July 2013) focusing on defect&#xD;      control within the dielectrics layers. Furthermore, the knowledge gained&#xD;      through our recent collaborative activities has allowed AVX (NI) to gain&#xD;      substantial credibility with USA customers such as NASA, BMW, Ford and the&#xD;      European Space Agency. New device characterisation and fabrication&#xD;      capabilities introduced by NIBEC include, Electrical Impedance&#xD;      Spectroscopy, FIB preparation of lamellae and HRTEM analysis, XPS and&#xD;      ToF-SIMs, particle size analysis (BET, electroacoustic and dynamic light&#xD;      scattering), new wetting and dispersion technology and a rare earth dopant&#xD;      programme. All of these interactions have impacted on international sales,&#xD;      growth, global market penetration and job sustainability. Joint&#xD;      publications, publicity and sponsored PhD programmes have resulted,&#xD;      leading to a strong and fruitful relationship.&#xD;    SiSaf Ltd.: SiSaf is a spin-in to NIBEC and is developing drug&#xD;      delivery formulations that use a patented bioactive and non-toxic form of&#xD;      silicon nanoparticles (&amp;#8804; 50nm) that are designed to allow compounds to&#xD;      penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin without adverse effects [2].&#xD;      Using the extensive knowledgebase acquired over the last 15 years in the&#xD;      area of nanomaterials, NIBEC is assisting the company to develop improved&#xD;      fabrication and characterisation techniques. NIBEC have a senior staff&#xD;      representative on the board as CSO (JMcL). SiSafs core fabrication and&#xD;      characterisation laboratories are based at NIBEC and with the investment&#xD;      of two joint &amp;#163;250k INI R&amp;amp;D grants, various consultancies and&#xD;      collaborative work, NIBEC and SiSaf have jointly developed a wide range of&#xD;      capabilities in silicon nanoparticle production. This work has led to an&#xD;      expansion of SiSaf to seven staff, increased laboratory space and&#xD;      enhancement of their patent, IP and knowledge assets. High quality silicon&#xD;      nanoparticles (50-100nm) are routinely batch-produced, functionalised,&#xD;      doped with drugs and characterised for trials and marketing samples to&#xD;      customers.&#xD;    This interaction has already led to a better understanding of the&#xD;      fundamental properties of Si nanoparticles, its dependence of the&#xD;      formulation route and a more efficient processing protocol. The research&#xD;      has directly impacted on the valuation of the company with NIBEC staff&#xD;      producing key reports and know-how in a number of important areas, namely:&#xD;      the nature, size and surface characteristics of the 50 nm silicon&#xD;      nanoparticles; three technical reports on the scale-up viability for&#xD;      nanoparticle production via (i) arc deposition, (ii) via - milling and&#xD;      (iii) via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) for production of smaller&#xD;      particles. Biocompatibility (and in particular nano-toxicity) has been&#xD;      investigated by NIBEC and a technical report issued which has impacted&#xD;      beneficially on investor confidence through our findings of non-toxicity&#xD;      which would have been a major barrier to full commercialisation. The&#xD;      company now has a valuation of &amp;#163;3.5m and is completing a set of &amp;#163;1.5m&#xD;      human trials in the USA to determine the suitability of the product for&#xD;      topical application. It has a Silicon Valley office at ITLG with John&#xD;      Hartnett as lead investor along with IUL, Crescent Capital and a set of&#xD;      private angels [7,8]. The impact of having NIBEC team on board is&#xD;      significant and the following points were key to improving the company's&#xD;      overall value: nanoparticle fabrication (via plasma, CVD, wet etching and&#xD;      milling); nanoparticle characterisation via HRTEM, dynamic light&#xD;      scattering and zeta potential dispersion analysis, pharmaokinetics and&#xD;      nanotoxicity testing with human cell lines [2]. In summary the company is&#xD;      in a strong position, with over &amp;#163;2m of investment to date and with Human&#xD;      Clinical trials near completion, Suzanne Siebert (CEO) has said&#xD;        "NIBEC's impact on the company has been critical, and as we develop even&#xD;        stronger international relationships in India, USA and throughout&#xD;        Europe, these engineers, who underpin our work are highly important&#xD;        partners".&#xD;    SEAGATE: In 1994 the then core nanotechnology team at NIBEC, in&#xD;      conjunction with colleagues in QUB and local government agencies, were&#xD;      instrumental in attracting Seagate Technologies to locate a major&#xD;      production facility in the UK (in competition with South America, eastern&#xD;      Europe and Asia). The subsequent NIBEC relationships with Seagate R&amp;amp;D&#xD;      in both the UK and the USA were developed around nanoscale coatings of&#xD;      diamond-like carbon on a new generation of GMR read-write head devices.&#xD;      The NIBEC team utilised a novel plasma immersion technique called Filtered&#xD;      Cathodic Vacuum Arc (FCVA) that was developed in conjunction with Veeco&#xD;      Instruments (USA). This, along with our development of specific metrology&#xD;      protocols for analysing AlTiC ceramics, led to ultra-hard layers (30 GPa)&#xD;      with a credible measured thickness of 1.5nm, the world's thinnest&#xD;      continuous carbon coatings [3].

&#xD;    &#xD;    </Sources><Title>&#xD;    Ulster - Bringing nanomaterials research to industrial production.&#xD;    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Metallurgy and Materials</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>&#xD;    The Nanotechnology R&amp;amp;D activities within NIBEC have a coordinated&#xD;      focus on developing a fundamental understanding of how materials&#xD;      processing impacts on the resultant characteristics and properties of&#xD;      ultra-thin films (&amp;lt;2nm), nanoparticles and surface properties at the&#xD;      nanoscale [1-4]. We have an established track record in the preparation,&#xD;      analysis and processing of materials including diamond-like carbon (DLC),&#xD;      carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene, and various nanoparticle systems (Si,&#xD;      group IV alloys, ferroelectric ceramics, and metal oxides). This area has&#xD;      received substantial support from EPSRC, the Royal Society, the EU&#xD;      Framework Programmes (FP4 - FP7) and InvestNI in collaboration with and/or&#xD;      through direct funded from industry (Seagate, AVX, SiSaf, Intel,&#xD;      Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Schrader Electronics, Analog Devices, TFX Medical,&#xD;      Medtronic, Labcoat, Kelvatech, Randox). The strategic aim of this research&#xD;      is to advance the understanding of nanomaterials for device fabrication&#xD;      and to promote its integration into advanced industrial manufacture [5].&#xD;      The associated publications highlight our expertise in fabrication &amp;amp;&#xD;      advanced characterisation that led to direct industry impact (PP, PM, PL).&#xD;    A number of targeted equipment grants have led to the creation of one of&#xD;      the most advanced academic nanomaterials research facilities in Europe&#xD;      (&amp;#163;15m of capital investment in the last 10 years from SRIF, RCIF, DEL,&#xD;      EPSRC)[6]. Recent highlights include novel equipment for the creation of&#xD;      ultra-thin carbon/CNT/graphene films, a nanoparticle production laboratory&#xD;      and advanced characterisation based on our new HRTEM. Our fundamental&#xD;      strengths have centred on; (i) advancing metrology for measuring&#xD;      nano-scale hardness, film thickness, internal stress and adhesive strength&#xD;      on ultra-thin (1-50nm) carbon layers; (ii) nanoparticle fabrication (via&#xD;      laser, microplasma, milling and wet chemical synthesis) and&#xD;      characterisation of both the materials and the synthesis processes; (iii)&#xD;      nano-scale surface-engineering and functionalisation with associated&#xD;      high-resolution analysis (HRTEM, ToF-SIMS, XPS). The recently established&#xD;      &amp;#163;2m nanoparticle laboratory is key to the synthesis, characterisation and&#xD;      understanding the unique properties of dispersed nanoparticles and it has&#xD;      attracted industry (AVX, Bombardier, SiSaf and Randox) to support our&#xD;      research.&#xD;    For material synthesis, our primary strength is in plasma-based&#xD;      deposition, surface engineering and functionalization. We have at hand a&#xD;      large number of plasma systems operating from DC up to microwave&#xD;      frequencies and from vacuum to atmospheric pressure. We host advanced&#xD;      pilot-scale industrial systems supplied through collaboration with&#xD;      equipment manufacturers. These include a custom-built microwave plasma&#xD;      system (Seiki, Japan), which was the world's first system for the&#xD;      deposition of highly oriented nanotubes [1- 3] and a FCVA - filtered&#xD;      cathodic vacuum arc system (NTI Technologies, Singapore) for the&#xD;      deposition of hydrogen-free highly diamond-like carbons for Seagate. The&#xD;      research groups involved have also designed and constructed a suite of&#xD;      advanced multi-functional plasma systems in-house, including pilot&#xD;      (reel-reel) production systems with integrated specialist diagnostic tools&#xD;      for concurrent measurement of plasma and material properties during the&#xD;      growth of nanoparticles. This facility is being further developed towards&#xD;      providing low- pressure and atmospheric pressure capabilities for general&#xD;      large area/low cost processing and precision three-dimensional coatings&#xD;      for medical implants. We have four patents awarded and active&#xD;      commercialisation in progress. Recently a University of Ulster spin-out&#xD;      company Surf Spec Ltd was established (BM) to exploit aspects of plasma&#xD;      surface modification as they apply to biomaterials. In-house materials&#xD;      characterisation is complemented by access to international synchrotron&#xD;      (Daresbury, Diamond, CERN) and neutron diffraction (Rutherford Appleton)&#xD;      facilities via numerous CCLRC and EU awards.&#xD;    We have secured funding for 15 projects related to nanomaterials and of&#xD;      these, two major research awards, totalling &amp;#163;1.6m since 2008, involve&#xD;      collaboration with AVX Ltd (TB, PL). The research aims to link&#xD;      fundamental ceramic nanoparticle properties to industrial processing&#xD;      conditions. The resultant impact on the electrical and reliability&#xD;      characteristics of multi-layer capacitor devices has allowed the company&#xD;      to develop a new generation of high value products. Core elements of this&#xD;      work along with the processing expertise developed are now also being&#xD;      targeted at the development of ceramic/clay fillers for Bombardier.&#xD;    SiSaf Ltd are a 2009 spin-in company with NIBEC staff on the board&#xD;      as CSO/Director. A collaborative research venture with NIBEC aims to&#xD;      produce and functionalise nanoparticle silicon for use in drug and&#xD;      therapeutic transdermal delivery applications (TB, JMcL, BM). This work&#xD;      relies on the provision of high-quality and precisely controlled 50nm&#xD;      particles of Si with defined porosity/surface properties in order to allow&#xD;      specific functionalisation and drug attachment. This has involved in-vitro&#xD;      testing of Si particle nano-toxicity at the NIBEC Cell Culture Facility&#xD;      (BM). The data has provided the platform for a vitamin C dissolution study&#xD;      in an animal model which indicated that the SiSaf delivery system is 30%&#xD;      better than a standard drug delivery system. Current studies are examining&#xD;      the use of nano-silicon for transdermal therapeutic delivery involving a&#xD;      USA based human clinical trial. SiSaf won the 2010 Award for Most&#xD;      Promising Technology at the Irish Technology Leadership Group (ITLG)&#xD;      awards ceremony in Silicon Valley, USA.&#xD;    The majority of the carbon-based ultra-thin film and nanoparticles work&#xD;      commenced in 2000 arising from the burgeoning global interest in&#xD;      diamond-like carbon (DLC), carbon nanotubes (CNT) and graphene for&#xD;      electrical, optical and mechanical applications (PM, PP JMcL). Our&#xD;      research was guided in the main via company initiated collaborations with&#xD;      Seagate Technology, Daewoo Electronics and TFX Medical [4,&#xD;      6]. Each company had a particular requirement for ultra- thin, low&#xD;      friction, dense (pin-hole free) and durable films of 1 nm (Seagate) - 20&#xD;      nm (TFX) in thickness. The experience gained in delivering the challenging&#xD;      specifications set down by these globally leading companies provided the&#xD;      model for the NIBEC technology transfer process and it is currently&#xD;      focussed on the controlled growth and properties of CNT arrays for&#xD;      biomedical and biosensor applications. Original work in the application of&#xD;      CNTs has led to the development of inventive electrochemical platforms for&#xD;      bio-sensing applications, several of which are now patent protected. Also&#xD;      a spin-out company, Graphene International Ltd (2012) has recently&#xD;      been established by PP with patents and licenses in the area of graphene&#xD;      production scale-up.&#xD;    </UnderpinningResearch></CaseStudyDump><CaseStudyDump><CaseStudyId>2326</CaseStudyId><Continent><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>6255148</GeoNamesId><Name>Europe</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>6255147</GeoNamesId><Name>Asia</Name></GeoLocation></Continent><Country><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>2264397</GeoNamesId><Name>Portugal</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>2635167</GeoNamesId><Name>United Kingdom</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>146669</GeoNamesId><Name>Cyprus</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>1814991</GeoNamesId><Name>China</Name></GeoLocation></Country><Funders xmlns:a="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><a:string>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</a:string></Funders><ImpactDetails>
    The research described above, and in particular development of virtual
      substrates and Ge epitaxy, led to the launch of a spin-out company in
      2003. Starting with &amp;#163;2 M of venture capital funding and six employees, AdvanceSis
      aimed to commercialise outputs from Warwick's NanoSilicon Group patent
      portfolio [7]. AdvanceSis was initially nurtured within the Dept
      of Physics, with a minimum of bureaucracy and full access to facilities.
      This enabled the company rapidly to develop both the epitaxial know-how
      and business acumen required for expansion [10]. In 2005, AdvanceSis
      won the Lord Stafford Award for `Best University Spin Out'. A significant
      aspect of the business was to supply Ge-on-Si wafers into the R&amp;amp;D
      programme of a major semiconductor company that led (in 2009) to a
      prototype short-range optical link using Ge detectors. AdvanceSis
      were complimented on producing much higher quality wafers than other
      sub-contractors and delivering to schedule.
    AdvanceSis moved to its own premises on the University of Warwick
      Science Park in 2008 and identified a market niche in solar-power
      generation by concentrator photo-voltaic (CPV) tech- nology, initially
      using Ge solar cells. To reflect this, in 2009 the company changed its
      name to Circadian Solar [11]. By improving the efficiency of both
      the solar cell material, advanced optics and sun-tracking control systems
      accurate to 0.4&amp;#186;, Circadian Solar made 30 m2 systems of
      CPV modules that were more than twice as efficient as typical commercial
      Si panels and could produce solar electricity at close to the critical
      $1/W fully installed cost in regions with high levels of sun- shine [12].
      As chairman of the board, Prof. Parker assisted the company, between 2003
      and 2010, in raising a further &amp;#163;12 M from Seven Spires Investments Ltd.,
      who saw
    "excellent management, defensible Intellectual Property, a well
      characterised route to market and global scalability to an expected market
      capitalisation in excess of $100 M." [13]
    In 2010, Circadian Solar was ranked 16th on a list of
      top university spin-out companies [14] and, by the end of 2011, was
      established as a fully independent company employing 35 people and with a
      'net worth' of &amp;#163;3.5 M [15].
    Employees include a number of researchers trained to PhD level in the
      NanoSilicon Group (Parsons, Nash, Fulgoni, Palmer, Capewell) and also
      ex-motor industry workers from the West Midlands. Coventry South MP spoke
      of the importance of the company whilst visiting in 2009:
    "The Midlands used to be the home of the automotive industry so this
      region has been one of the hardest hit by job losses resulting from the
      recession. Now we need to look to new industries such as solar power to
      revitalise the region and help move us towards a low carbon economy. We
      have the facilities, design expertise and skilled workforce in place to
      capitalise on any investment made into this fledgling industry that has
      such great potential." [16]
    The growth of the company has generated business and employment for
      sub-contractors not only in the UK but also abroad. In 2009, tf2
        devices B.V. was created as a joint venture with Radboud University,
      Nijmegen, [17] to exploit the epitaxial lift-off process for III-V
      semiconductors used to make Circadian's CPV modules. As part of the
      company's plan to demonstrate cost-effective energy yield in different
      regions and environments module evaluation was performed in Cyprus in late
      2008, and in 2010 Circadian established a test facility for its CPV solar
      energy system in Lisbon to take advantage of the high level of direct
      sunlight in Portugal [12].
    With the solar cell market in 2013 being dominated by Chinese state
      subsidised large-area, low- efficiency silicon panels (having a fully
      installed cost of well under $1/W), many solar companies across the
      Western world have collapsed. By contrast, Circadian Solar
      survived (albeit with a reduced valuation in July 2013 of &amp;#163;1.5 M). The
      major impact in the REF Impact period has thus been to directly generate
      employment and through the spending of over &amp;#163;10 M in the economy including
      sourcing components from sub-contractors.
    Impact has also been achieved through:
    (i) Collaborating with Industry on Research &amp;#8212; Many European
      companies started work in the SiGe field during the 1990's; the Warwick
      group collaborated and published with Daimler-Chrysler, Philips, Siemens
      (Infineon, Quimoda), ST Microelectronics among others. In the REF period,
      we have supplied several industrial collaborators with extremely high
      quality epitaxial material. For example, in 2008-10, Warwick supplied 120
      epitaxial wafers of Ge layers on Si substrates to IMEC, where the
      transistors were fabricated in a silicon industry compatible 65 nm process
      by Intel employees to create the first strained-Ge transistors [18]. In
      2009, over 100 wafers were supplied to MPI Halle for developing a layer
      transfer process to create Ge-on-insulator platforms. We have also applied
      our expertise and characterisation facilities to analyse devices made by
      companies. In a joint activity with device modellers from University of
      Udine, NXP Semiconductors (now part of TSMC) benefitted from a greater
      understanding of their FinFET devices [19]:
    "Key to building this understanding is the development and experimental
      verification of charge transport models. The characterisation ...
      performed by the Warwick team has led to new insights and supported
      greatly the development of predictive transport models that can be
      incorporated into device simulation tools. In this way the expertise and
      capabilities of the Warwick team have impacted both the development costs
      and development time of novel finFET-based CMOS technologies." [20]
    TSMC is now entering production with 20 nm node FinFETs [21], and these
      could well become 20% of their $14 B annual revenue within the next 10
      years.
    (ii) Industrially Relevant Training &amp;#8212; PhD students and PDRAs in
      the Group have not only developed expertise in using advanced equipment
      for fabrication and characterisation of semi- conductor devices, but have
      also engaged with our collaborative partners (mentioned in (i) above).
      This has included making use of exchange programmes with companies through
      the SiNANO networks [9, 22] that Parker and Leadley played a pivotal role
      in setting up. 15 PhD graduates and PDRAs from the NanoSilicon Group (list
      available on request) have gone on to use their specific expertise working
      for a number of companies and research institutes incl. AmberWave, IMEC,
      International Rectifier, IQE, NXP, Philips, QinetiQ, Sharp, VG Semicon,
      and Circadian Solar. These employed researchers have continued to
      contribute to high technology development and to the economy throughout
      the REF Impact period.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research carried out at Warwick into the growth of silicon-based layered
      semiconductors has had a variety of impacts in the fields of
      microelectronics and solar energy generation. In 2004, a spin- out company
      AdvanceSis was created to exploit the patent portfolio of Warwick's
      NanoSilicon Group, with an initial &amp;#163;300 k of Regional Development Fund
      support. The company, having focused on the business of solar energy
      generation through concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) technology and renamed
      Circadian Solar, was valued at &amp;#163;3.5 million by the end of 2011.
      Further impact of the Warwick silicon research, in the period since 2008,
      has come in the form of joint R&amp;amp;D programmes with companies in the
      electronics and ICT sectors, including supplying advanced semiconductor
      materials and by providing highly skilled employees trained in the
      research group.

    Impact of research into strained silicon on the electronics and energy
        sectors
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Physics</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    Most computers worldwide now contain strained silicon. In essence, strain
      distorts the Si crystal lattice, allowing electrons within it to travel
      faster. This improves microprocessor speed and has been employed by Intel
      since the 90 nm technology node in 2000, through the current 22 nm
      production node, to all planned future transistors. The crucial required
      understanding of the effects of strain arose from research on SiGe epitaxy
      (the controlled deposition of material in sequential atomic layers), in
      which the Warwick NanoSilicon research group has played a significant
      part. The group was established in 1986 by Prof. Evan Parker and has
      published over 200 journal papers related to silicon-based epitaxy since
      1993 [e.g. 1-3]. From 1997 to 2003, the Warwick Group led the EPSRC "SiGe
      for MOS Technologies" programme [8], with leading European industrial
      partners, that both created a UK community in the research field and was
      instrumental in establishing germanium as an essential component for
      developing new technologies.
    Germanium has a much larger hole mobility than Si, which is attractive
      for the p-channel in CMOS; Ge also has a smaller bandgap than silicon,
      which gives it advantages as a light absorber within a solar cell or as
      photon detector. However, the natural spacing between Ge atoms is 4%
      larger than for Si which makes growing Ge directly on the ubiquitous Si
      substrate a challenge; strain relaxation during epitaxial growth can lead
      to a very high density of dislocations that is detrimental to device
      performance. So another inventive step was required: during 2000-2004 the
      Warwick Group embarked on research to create smooth strain-tuning buffers
      (`virtual substrates' VS that enable a transition from the Si substrate to
      an arbitrary SiGe alloy, with the surface layer being fully relaxed). The
      threading defect density was reduced from above 1010cm-2
      to below 106cm-2 (an acceptable level for device
      processing) whilst maintaining a surface roughness below a few nanometres
      for a Si0.5Ge0.5 alloy [4] and ~1 nm for a 20% Ge
      alloy. Silicon layers grown on top of these platforms would be biaxially
      compressive strained, whilst Ge layers would be tensile strained. The
      novelty of the Warwick approach came in the method of increasing the Si1-xGex
      alloy composition through the virtual substrate (from x=0 at the Si
      substrate) and in the initial surface preparation. This research in novel
      types of epitaxial growth led to a portfolio of patents [7], which in turn
      led to the creation of the spin-out company AdvanceSis for their
      exploitation.
    In a parallel development by the NanoSilicon group working with AdvanceSis,
      fully relaxed Ge layers were produced directly on Si through a two-step
      growth procedure: a thin initial `seed layer' of Ge is deposited at a low
      growth temperature, which accommodates the change in lattice para- meter
      by forming a dense network of dislocations; a second thicker layer of Ge
      is grown at much higher temperature that encourages dislocation glide and
      annihilation, resulting in a smooth relaxed Ge surface. Such material was
      shown to be suitable for solar photovoltaic and infrared detector
      applications [5]. These platforms also provided a route to integrating Ge
      and III-V semi- conductor heterostructures (such as used for LEDs and
      laser diodes) onto silicon, which opens the possibility of combining the
      processing power of silicon electronics with the added optical
      functionality of the other materials.
    Finally, these two developments were combined to create `reverse graded
      virtual substrates' that start from a relaxed Ge layer grown by the
      two-temperature method and then decrease the Ge fraction from x=1 in a
      series of Si1-xGex alloy layers [6]. With such
      structures the substrate required to support a strained Ge layer can be
      much thinner, and of better quality, than with conventional forward
      grading. Indeed, we have produced a two-dimensional hole gas with a
      low-temperature mobility of over 1.5x106cm2/Vs in
      such a strained Ge heterostructure.
    A vital factor in enabling impact, was the major investment by Warwick in
      an industrially compatible epitaxy system (2003). The ASM Epsilon 2000E
      reduced pressure chemical vapour deposition tool enabled us to produce
      wafers meeting the exacting standards of industry, in sufficient quantity.

    The team's research into Osteoarthritis was first reported in a paper&#xD;
      published in The Knee in 2004 that led to subsequent development&#xD;
      of "proofs of concepts" through to our current work. This led to the&#xD;
      development of new methods of movement analysis and biomechanical&#xD;
      modelling techniques that we are now using in our current work. With a&#xD;
      mission to improve the quality of life of patients treated by Allied&#xD;
      Health Professionals, our work pursues this goal by performing basic and&#xD;
      applied research, and by developing new techniques in the assessment of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. The team also advises medical&#xD;
      staff on methods of conservative management of knee pain through invited&#xD;
      talks to clinical groups internationally.&#xD;
    The applied clinical nature of the work is firmly rooted in the every-day&#xD;
      world of clinical practice. Although some of the tools used in this&#xD;
      research are very advanced and only available in specialist research units&#xD;
      the focus has always to be to produce results that are clinically useful.&#xD;
      When considering clinical utility the aim is to provide clinicians with&#xD;
      evidence about patient management or new tools to assist in patient&#xD;
      management. By helping to optimise clinical practice the health and&#xD;
      well-being of patients attending for conservative management of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal conditions is improved.&#xD;
    The findings of the research team suggest that there are many benefits in&#xD;
      terms of joint stability and control that had gone previously undetected&#xD;
      which had led many clinicians to doubt the therapeutic benefit of some&#xD;
      conservative management. The research team at the University of Central&#xD;
      Lancashire has now developed a program of work to systematically assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of different levels of conservative and surgical&#xD;
      management. The effect of surgical management of knee osteoarthritis using&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty was initially tested by Dr Dominic Thewlis (a&#xD;
      former PhD student and now a senior lecturer of University of South&#xD;
      Australia). This has now been followed up by considering a spectrum of&#xD;
      conservative and surgical managements to give comparative guidance of what&#xD;
      biomechanical and clinical outcomes clinicians could expect.&#xD;
    Dissemination of these research findings has been to academic and&#xD;
      professional conferences but often, more importantly, through specific CPD&#xD;
      activities which are particularly effective at influencing clinical&#xD;
      practice. Some of this research has been translated into other languages&#xD;
      including Persian, Flemish and Chinese, and is cited by other&#xD;
      international research groups. It appears that a wide international&#xD;
      audience of clinicians and academics have been influenced.&#xD;
    From this research evidence base key members of staff have delivered&#xD;
      expert advice to clinical groups in Europe (1995 onwards), USA (2007&#xD;
      onwards), China (2010 onwards) and South East Asia (2011 onwards), South&#xD;
      America (2012 onwards), and receive invitations to speak at conferences&#xD;
      worldwide on a regular basis. This has included over 150 invited talks to&#xD;
      clinical groups, professional sports clubs, commercial companies, academic&#xD;
      groups in over 20 different countries between 2008 and 2013. This&#xD;
      dissemination has helped the acceptance of conservative treatment before&#xD;
      surgical management in Europe and the US and is now being used throughout&#xD;
      China and South East Asia, which has improved the clinical options of&#xD;
      Allied Health Professionals and Orthopaedic Surgeons. This has led to more&#xD;
      than 1,000 patients worldwide now receiving conservative management for&#xD;
      Knee Osteoarthritis and Patellofemoral pain since 2010 as a direct result&#xD;
      of this work who would not of otherwise been treated conservatively&#xD;
      (source DJO Global inc.). Since 2007 the research team have been directly&#xD;
      involved in prototype development and testing of new knee braces and other&#xD;
      conservative managements for many companies including DJO Inc., Vista&#xD;
      California, USA with the focus being on maximising patient benefits.&#xD;
    The reach of our work can be further evidenced by the authoring of&#xD;
      relevant books and being invited to contribute book chapters including;&#xD;
      Clinical Case Studies in Physiotherapy (2008), Biomechanics in Clinic and&#xD;
      Research (2008), Biomechanics in Clinic and Research: Chinese edition&#xD;
      (2011) and the new edition of Whittles Gait Analysis (2012), Tidy's&#xD;
      Physiotherapy 13th, 14th and 15th editions (2006 -&#xD;
      2012) and Mercer's Textbook of Orthopaedics and Trauma (2012). As a result&#xD;
      of these academic contributions patients with complex musculoskeletal and&#xD;
      neurological disorders are regularly referred from around the UK by GPs,&#xD;
      Orthopaedic surgeons and Allied Health Professions for advanced&#xD;
      biomechanical assessments to assist clinical decision making in their&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    The key driver for this research is to provide clinicians with robust&#xD;
      tools that they can use to evaluate, treat and therefore improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcome in their patients. Our research has assisted the&#xD;
      development of the evidence base of many clinical treatments and&#xD;
      assessment tools. This has led to the design and development of new&#xD;
      rehabilitation products and medical devices in partnership with both large&#xD;
      companies and small to medium sized enterprises. The core impact of this&#xD;
      work has been improvements in patient care and quality of life by&#xD;
      improving the efficacy and effectiveness in these areas with a particular&#xD;
      focus on the advancement of conservative management and lower limb&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;

    Since 2004 Professor Jim Richards and Professor James Selfe have&#xD;
      contributed to the clinical understanding of movement control and the&#xD;
      effect of treatments of unstable and painful knee joints. This work has&#xD;
      shown the biomechanical and clinical effectiveness of several different&#xD;
      conservative and surgical managements and the efficacy of rehabilitation&#xD;
      devices and led to the development of new outcome measures.&#xD;
    Within knee osteoarthritis the most common treatments are surgical to&#xD;
      realign the knee; from 2005 onwards research at the University of Central&#xD;
      Lancashire has shown that the amount of physical correction possible with&#xD;
      knee bracing is similar to that of some surgery procedures with similar&#xD;
      associated reductions in pain and improvements in function. In addition&#xD;
      our work on patellofemoral pain was the first to determine the&#xD;
      biomechanical effects on the three dimensional movement and control of the&#xD;
      knee when using taping and bracing in 2008. This work highlighted&#xD;
      improvements in the knee control, and in collaboration with colleagues at&#xD;
      the University of Manchester (Dr Mike Callaghan &amp;amp; Prof Jackie Oldham)&#xD;
      we have established that patellofemoral patients demonstrate clinically&#xD;
      important proprioceptive deficits (2008), therefore identifying the&#xD;
      possible proprioception and mechano-reception mechanism through which&#xD;
      these treatments work. This work has changed clinical practice with the&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of proprioception now routine in these patients.&#xD;
      In 2011 clinical studies, derived from these early "proof of principle"&#xD;
      studies, further explored the improvements in control and mapped to these&#xD;
      improvements in self-reported pain and function in patellofemoral pain&#xD;
      sufferers.&#xD;
    Biomechanical and clinical data were collected to determine the&#xD;
      mechanical efficacy and clinical effectiveness on a range of products for&#xD;
      a range of musculoskeletal problems including Knee Osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      Patellofemoral Pain and lower limb rehabilitation. One example of this&#xD;
      came from our research on the exploration of the biomechanics of squatting&#xD;
      tasks and their implications for lower limb rehabilitation. Single-limb&#xD;
      squats on a decline angle have been suggested as a rehabilitative&#xD;
      intervention to target the knee extensors, however very little empirical&#xD;
      research exists documenting the optimum angle of decline. Our work&#xD;
      explored the use of squatting using decline boards and aimed to determine&#xD;
      the optimum angle and the most effective regimen. Our paper, published in&#xD;
      the Journal of Athletic Training (Richards et al, 2008), was the first to&#xD;
      determine the biomechanics of such exercises, and suggests the optimum&#xD;
      angles for different rehabilitation purposes. This work led to the&#xD;
      development of a new rehabilitation device, the "Rehab Angel", which&#xD;
      allows the decline angle to be adjusted based on our findings. This device&#xD;
      is now commercially available and is being used in many rehabilitation&#xD;
      centres and professional sports clubs in a variety of knee and other lower&#xD;
      limb pathologies.&#xD;
    Our research has also supported the development and product testing of&#xD;
      many new devices that aim to reduce pain and improve function. This has&#xD;
      assisted large companies from the USA through to small/medium-sized&#xD;
      enterprises (SMEs) in the UK. Between 2007 and 2009 20 UK SMEs were&#xD;
      assisted in product testing and development. This led to 20 new jobs being&#xD;
      created and an increase in sales of &amp;#163;750k and &amp;#163;1.1 m sales safeguarded&#xD;
      over this time period when audited by the European Regional Development&#xD;
      Agency. This work led to several new products making it to market that&#xD;
      have shown successful application in the clinical management of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal problems.&#xD;

    Nearly all solid medicines like tablets and capsules contain drugs in
      crystalline form; and all crystals have the potential to `morph' into not
      one but many alternative forms. The likelihood of the crystals actually
      changing and becoming a danger to patients is very small but it can and
      does happen, with catastrophic consequences.
    In 1988, a clinical failure of Tegretol (carbamazepine) tablets, the
      anticonvulsant widely used with epilepsy, was observed. It was believed to
      be caused by a phase conversion from the anhydrate to dehydrate form. In
      1998 Abbott Laboratories withdrew Norvir (ritonavir), essential at that
      time in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, because the capsules unexpectedly
      failed dissolution tests. The public were without an essential drug while
      researchers investigated. They finally identified that the drug crystals
      had changed into a more stable, less soluble polymorph which contaminated
      laboratories and effectively halted production processes. They had to
      completely reformulate the drug and develop a new capsule product. The
      case cost Abbott hundreds of millions of dollars and over 600 scientists
      working for nearly a year to resolve the issue. The estimated loss in
      sales in 1998 alone is $250m.
    Pfizer experienced similar problems with two drugs in development and
      concluded that a deeper scientific knowledge of polymorphism was an
      emerging need in the pharmaceutical industry. The consequences were
      typically catastrophic, hard to predict, clinically and economically
      unacceptable, and damaging to patients' trust in the company to produce
      the quality products they relied on.
    Pfizer identified internal and external drivers for the need to
      understand polymorphism on a more scientifically rigorous basis. These
      drivers included:
    
      emphasis on the chemical rather than physical attributes of drugs and
        excipients;
      the instrumentation used to characterise polymorphism was relatively
        simplistic and unable to predict the potential for phase transition;
      the existing protocols to test physical performance required large
        quantities of expensive pure solid drug, and occurred too late in the
        development process to stimulate the re-engineering of defective
        crystalline drug forms;
      an industry-wide drive for more rapid drug development and clinical
        testing.
    
    Pfizer turned to the University of Greenwich to develop the scientific
      methodology to:
    
      produce small quantities of highly purified drug crystals, alone and
        in drug product matrices, from side streams of conventional pilot
        batches;
      use the pure drugs to develop tests on single crystals, a process
        which is much cheaper and can be performed at the start rather than end
        of the drug development process;
      develop tests that could predict polymorph instability and how they
        behave during manufacture, and in turn allow the engineering and
        understanding of new solid-state forms for development.
    
    Since 2008 Pfizer has been able to apply the resulting methodologies,
      systematically to the development of crystalline APIs for use in solid
      oral and inhalation dosage forms. The company has also applied them to
      understand the risk for products licensed from other companies not using
      this scientific paradigm. Pfizer has invested &amp;#163;2.4m in the university to
      date. The programme has resulted in critical technology and human resource
      transfer to the company as well as 27 refereed publications. To date 24
      researchers have progressed through the scheme; 40% have taken up posts
      within Pfizer and 42% with other leading pharmaceutical companies.
    The larger impacts are that Pfizer has vastly reduced the risk of
      polymorphism in its drugs, increasing the confidence of patients and
      health professionals. Examples of what might have happened without the
      university's pioneering research abound, for instance to UCB with
      Parkinson's disease drug rotigotine. Filed in 2003 as a drug that did not
      exhibit polymorphism, rotigotine was delivered through Neupro skin patches
      and many patients experienced an improved quality of life. In 2008,
      dendritic structures were observed: a new form polymorph had crystallised
      which reduced the patches' efficacy. The product was withdrawn in the US
      in 2008 and did not return to the market until 2012. Similarly, in 2010
      BMS withdrew 64 million Avalide tablets (hydrochlorthiazide and
      irbesartan) over concerns that irbesartan crystals had converted to a less
      soluble polymorph. Avalide sales were calculated to be $310 million in the
      first nine months of 2010. Pfizer is able to safeguard its patients and
      avoid the cost associated with recalls and the redevelopment and relaunch
      of clinically essential products.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Nearly all solid dosage forms contain drugs in crystalline form; and all
      crystals have the potential to `morph', suddenly, into different forms
      which can affect the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. A
      number of high-profile cases in which marketed medicines had to be
      withdrawn [Lee, et al., Annu. Rev. Chem. Biomol. Eng. 2011,
      2, 259-280] led multinational drug company Pfizer to conclude that
      a greater understanding of polymorphism was required to enable drug
      product design for the 21st Century. The University of
      Greenwich pioneered methods to predict crystal behaviour on the shelf and
      during manufacture that were affordable, timely and effective. It enabled
      Pfizer to select the optimal polymorphic drug form and manage risk
      associated with uncontrolled solid-state transformations, thereby
      safeguarding patients and avoiding huge costs.

    Managing risk associated with crystal polymorphism in pharmaceutical
      development

    Polymorphism is a phenomenon where drug molecules can adopt multiple
      crystalline packing arrangements or conformations in the solid state. It
      affects manufacturing performance, the stability of formulated medicines
      and the extent of oral absorption and hence the dose. An optimal
      polymorphic drug form must be selected that is thermodynamically stable.
      Pfizer did not have the analytical tools to provide a deep knowledge of
      the emerging importance of polymorphism. Pfizer identified Martin
        Snowden, with expertise in surface and colloid chemistry, and John
        Mitchell, a physical organic chemist, to lead research to develop
      the technology in four areas. Stephen Wicks, Vice President of
      Pharmaceutical Science and Technology and UK Development Director at
      Pfizer, led the technology transfer project.
    2.1 Production of highly pure crystals for physical and mechanical
        evaluation
    Flash-Liquid Chromatography is a purification method of choice for
      preparative separations of drug molecules. Flash-LC had limited ability to
      produce pure fractions for routine solid-state characterisation because of
      its reliance on UV detection: important organic solvents used to achieve
      high purity levels had high UV cut-offs; many new drug candidates lacked
      significant chromophores. The Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD)
      was adapted for use with Flash-LC to allow the routine preparation of
      Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for materials science analysis
      when UV detection was not possible. [3.1.1 and 3.1.2]
    2.2 Characterisation of crystal disorder to predict catastrophic
        solid-state transitions
    Single-crystal X-ray diffraction produces a complete model of a
      material's molecular and solid-state structure. Ab.initio
      prediction of crystal structure is also possible. The practice was
      considered using a combination of structural information and structure
      prediction methodologies to develop powerful structure prediction
      procedures for drug crystals and more complex solid-state forms, e.g.
      salts. [3.2.1-3.2.3]
    2.3 Prediction of processing properties of pharmaceutical powders
        using single crystals
    Manufacturing processes can be problematic when drug crystals deform
      elastically in production machinery. Particle physics investigations
      required large quantities of pure, expensive crystalline drug.
      Consequently such studies were deferred to a point in the development
      programme where change, however desirable, was impractical. Indentation
      techniques were developed using highly purified single crystals to
      investigate the processing performance of drug candidate crystals, very
      early in the development process, to provide the opportunity to engineer
      and substitute improved solid-state variants to avoid processing problems.
      [3.3.1-3.3.3]
    2.4 Chemical imaging of pharmaceutical products
    Conventional analytical techniques sample the average bulk
      characteristics of pharmaceutical products. It is possible to determine
      the total drug content in a tablet but not the distribution of particles
      within a matrix formed with other formulation excipients. With spatial and
      chemical information, obtained using near infrared and Raman spectroscopy,
      it is possible to generate chemical images of each ingredient within the
      formulation. The physicochemical form of drug, in the presence of
      excipient particles, in the sample can be determined along with the size
      of any material clustering and spatial position relative to other
      components. The interface with processing machinery can also be
      determined. This research increased process understanding and material
      attributes associated with the clinical performance of the product.

    The impact claimed in this study arises from the production and public
      availability of the corpus's texts and spoken audio in a variety of media
      - CD-ROM, DVD, and on-line - together with associated documentation,
      publications and access software. The consortium also published SARA, a
      concordance tool for search and analysis of the BNC.
    An estimated 2000 full licences (both personal and institutional
      licences) and 1800 copies of BNC Baby (a 4 million word sample of the full
      BNC) have been sold world wide since 2008. In addition, our Japanese
      distributor has distributed over 350 licences in the relevant period. [&amp;#167;5i]
    The impacts have been:
    1) A contribution to United Kingdom's cultural heritage. A
      century ago Oxford University researched and published the authoritative
      Oxford English Dictionary, based upon written texts. The 100-million-word
      British National Corpus (10 million spoken words) is a documentary record
      of written and spoken English representing a wide cross-section of British
      English, at the end of the 20th century.
    2) For dictionary makers, the BNC improves and adds value to
      their products, providing a unique selling point over their competitors,
      and enhancing educational value to purchasers of their dictionaries. The
      corpus was used by the dictionary publishers making up the original
      consortium: OUP, Longman and Chambers, in creating the Longman Dictionary
      of Contemporary English, the Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, and the
      Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.
    
      Longman Dictionaries' website states: "What is so unique about the
        Spoken Corpus is that it shows us how we really use English, not how we
        are supposed to use English or how we use it when we are writing. It
        reveals how very different the spoken word is from the written word. At
        last students will be able to study English in an exciting new range of
        ELT materials that represent English as it really is. For the first
        time, real spoken language has influenced the creation of a learner
        dictionary."
      Chambers 21st Century Dictionary claims "All Chambers dictionaries are
        supported by the British National Corpus, a 100-million-word database of
        written and spoken English that provides real evidence of how English is
        used."
      The Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionaries website says "We use the
        BNC to confirm our intuitions and also to tell us things we didn't
        already know, or may not have thought about. We can find out exactly
        what a word means, rather than what we think it means. We can see how it
        behaves grammatically and which words it collocates with. We use all
        this information when writing our learners` dictionaries."
    
    Since 2011, the Government of India (Central Institute of Indian
      Languages) has been collaborating with Longman Pearson to create bilingual
      dictionaries in English and eleven Indian languages. The English part has
      been developed using words and phrases culled from the BNC. According to
      the Project manager of the National Translation Mission "The lexicon is an
      important translation tool - kind of a spring board to push the mother
      tongues, many of which are threatened with very few speakers". [&amp;#167;5ii]
    David Crystal's chapter `Essential Grammar' for English language learners
      in The Longman Essential Activator draws on the BNC for examples of
      real-life English usage to help intermediate learners to better understand
      how to use grammar in written and spoken English. [&amp;#167;5iii]
    3) English language teachers world-wide, and the agencies that
      examine them, have better examples of contemporary spoken English to use
      in their studies, improving the standards of teaching and learning of
      English as a Foreign Language.
    In comments sent to researchers via the BNC registration page, Juan, an
      English teacher in Spain says he uses the recordings in his class so that
      his students become aware of the different accents in the UK. Another
      teacher uses it "for my students to practise repeating after the tapes to
      improve their pronunciation." Tdol, an English teacher in Japan, refers
      language users to the BNC (20/3/2008). A blog post by Monica Vlad, a
      language teacher from Romania recommends language learners consult the BNC
      to check on questions of usage "in a few easy steps without having to
      google endlessly and end up with some website or forum results &amp;#8212; you can`t
      really know how reliable they are."[iv] Other such comments from
      BNC user registrations demonstrate the reasons they are using it and the
      impact it has on improving teaching and learning of English as a foreign
      language:
    
      "Teaching English to Swedish students, exposing them to a range of
        accents."
      "As a teacher of English, for personal reasons, so as to check doubts
        about collocation, use... but also for professional reasons."
      "I am in English teacher in Spain and would like to use the recordings
        in my class so that my students become aware of the different accents in
        the UK."
      "I could use [the recordings] as authentic listening exercises
        especially with regard to different accents."
      "looking for recording by natives for my students"
    
    4) The BNC provides English language learners with access to
      copious audio and text examples from an authoritative source which they
      can use to become familiar with variation in English and to improve their
      own British English pronunciation and usage, supporting independent study.
      The BNC site registration records provide evidence that the spoken audio
      is used by learners for purposes such as "to know how to pronounce words
      and practice how to listen them within the context", "to refresh my
      English", "to learn more about British English", "to know how to pronounce
      words and practice how to listen them within the context", "just listen to
      refresh my English; it has been too long since I could talk to native
      speakers and listen to spoken English at large" and "I want to improve my
      English by listening to these audio files".
    5) The OCR school examinations board are using extracts of BNC
      conversation transcriptions originally published on the Phonetics
      Laboratory website in order to improve the quality of public examinations,
      and since March 2013 have been selling copies of the exam papers.[&amp;#167;5v]
      Analysis of natural English conversation is a key part of the English
      Language GCSE and A-level curricula.
    6) People all over the world with access to the internet use the
      BNC as an authoritative reference on English, without having to pay for it
      or buy dictionaries or other reference works. This has widened access to
      accurate information about present-day UK English. Many individual writers
      use BNC as a reference source relevant to questions of contemporary
      English usage. It is a superior resource in comparison with other online
      sources: Jonathan de Boyne Pollard claims BNC can be a more accurate
      source of word frequencies than Google hit counts.[&amp;#167;5vi]
    To demonstrate an estimate of the internet reach of the BNC, the search
      term British National Corpus yields 2.18 million hits on Google UK (cf.
      the 1.3m hits for their closest UK competitor, the Edinburgh map task
      corpus. The Google search engine lists over 80,000 blog posts and over
      17,000 discussions citing British National Corpus. However, large numbers
      of users look up words or phrases via various online search services,
      especially the public, simple search engine provided by the British
      Library on the main BNC site. According to Google there are currently
      about 18,300 incoming links to that site and about 1,330 direct links to
      the search engine.[&amp;#167;5vii]
    Other online language tools use the BNC as a basis Sharp Laboratories of
      Europe has created an on-line writing aid, `Just the Word' based upon BNC
      usage data. One user writes "I use it every day to check the combinability
      of a word, to see the context and get the feel of a word...It is such a
      great help!!! ...You are doing a tremendous job making a difference to
      those whose native language is not English."[&amp;#167;5viii]
    7) BNC is used as a source of data for natural language processing
        and speech technology industry e.g. Infochimps is a start-up company
      founded in 2010 that is making a market for people to buy and sell large
      datasets. This includes a dataset of word frequencies from the BNC
      available for download under a Creative Commons licence.[&amp;#167;5ix]
    8) People have used the BNC for more artistic applications: it
      was used as the source for "Found Poetry" by the Three Poets Tumblr blog.
      The poets pick a word and search for it in the BNC and create a poem from
      the results.[&amp;#167;5x] WordCount is an "online artistic experiment in
      the way we use language" based on the BNC. It presents the 86,800 most
      frequently used English words, shown visually scaled in order of
      commonness. Barbara Wallraff cited WordCount and BNC in an article about
      vocabulary use in 2008.[&amp;#167;5xi] It was also cited on the
      `Shape+Colour' blog by Jeremy Elder (2008).
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The 100-million-word British National Corpus of UK English texts and
      speech is used regularly and extensively as a reference resource on the
      contemporary English language. Its users include dictionary makers, school
      teachers in many countries, teachers of English as a second language, the
      OCR school examinations board, and many individual writers on the internet
      as a reference source about questions of contemporary English usage. Its
      use has led to improved English dictionaries that more accurately reflect
      actual usage: for Longman, Chambers and OUP dictionaries, use of the BNC
      provides a unique selling point over their competitors and enhanced
      educational value to readers. For students and English language teachers
      world-wide, the BNC provides more realistic examples of the usage of words
      and phrases in context, and in different registers, free of charge via
      various online search portals, and thus improved education in English.

    Variation is rampant in human language across speakers, gender
      differences, social classes and dialects. Language variation and use and
      the phonetic investigation of variation in speech are fundamental parts of
      linguistic research. Spoken language differs in important ways from the
      formal written language that underlies many dictionaries and language
      teaching material. The corpus was collected by the BNC Consortium, an
      industrial/academic partnership initiated by Oxford University Press,
      joined by two other dictionary publishers, Longman and Chambers, together
      with corpus linguistics researchers from Oxford University, Lancaster
      University, and the British Library's Research and Innovation Centre.
    Lou Burnard (Applications Programmer Manager until 1995; Manager,
      Humanities Computing Unit 1995-2001; Assistant Director, Computing
      Services, 2001-2010; retired 9/2010) was responsible for Oxford
      University's participation in the consortium project, especially the
      design of its encoding scheme, and subsequent curation and worldwide
      distribution of the corpus. Professor John Coleman (Director of the
      Phonetics Laboratory at the University of Oxford since 1993) was
      responsible for a collaboration with the British Library to digitize the
      spoken recordings, and for two successive projects that have aligned the
      transcriptions to the audio, anonymized the relevant portions, and
      published the speech in its entirety.
    The initial iteration of the BNC was created by an academic/industrial
      consortium with joint DTI/SERC funding until 1994 with a second edition
      published in 2001, a major revision of the corpus produced a third (XML),
      more readily-accessible edition in March 2007. [Reference 1]. Oxford's
      roles in the consortium were linguistic structural mark-up of the texts
      (collected and supplied by the publishers) in standard formats (SGML;
      later, XML following the conventions of the Text Encoding Initiative),
      validation of its consistency, documentation, and publication.
      Part-of-speech tags were provided by Lancaster University. Oxford
      University Press, Longman and Chambers obtained and digitized the text
      samples and managed their IP/copyright permissions, and Longman collected
      or arranged for collection and transcription of the spoken audio
      recordings, on cassette tapes. The British Library curated those tapes
      which, until 2011, could only be audited by visiting their Sound Archive
      in person.
    In 2009-2013, the British Library digitized the original audio recordings
      of the 10-million word spoken part; Oxford University Phonetics Laboratory
      played the crucial role of automatically aligning them with their
      transcriptions, and published the anonymized audio and time-aligned
      transcriptions on-line [Reference 2]. To enable modern web browsers to
      access any desired audio clip from any of the recordings, the Laboratory
      implemented server-side audio fragment streaming. Because it is a
      well-documented on-line publication, users easily find it by generic
      search engine enquiries such as "spoken BNC". It is an excellent source of
      data for natural language processing and speech technology and commercial
      communications research. Oxford researchers have also published on-line
      and print reference and handbook documentation [References 3, 4].

    In the REF impact period, the MERI modelling group's simulation expertise&#xD;
      has achieved economic impact through improved product and&#xD;
        process understanding. This range of outward-facing activities&#xD;
      undertaken by the group is illustrated here in the contexts of a small&#xD;
      company (Fluid Maintenance Solutions), an SME (ZBD Displays)&#xD;
      and a multinational (Kodak).&#xD;
    Fluid Maintenance Solutions (FMS) [A] is a&#xD;
      South-Yorkshire-Based small company specialising in the recovery of high&#xD;
      value metals contained within sump sludges. FMS's core activity is&#xD;
      a recycling process in which thin contaminant films of hydrocarbon are&#xD;
      removed from poly-disperse metallic particulates. FMS first&#xD;
      engaged with the MERI modelling group in 2008 via the coordinated&#xD;
      Knowledge Transfer activity Nanofactory (REF3a(b)). This enabled a&#xD;
      sustained intervention in which Halliday determined the key&#xD;
      decontamination mechanism in FMS's recycling process and developed&#xD;
      a LB-based model, based on reference [5], with which to simulate it. FMS&#xD;
      had no in-house expertise capable of undertaking such work. In 2010,&#xD;
      Halliday delivered a final report setting out simulations performed to&#xD;
      investigate the viscous shear stress effects underpinning the&#xD;
      decontamination stage of FMS's re-cycling process. The insight&#xD;
      this gave FMS into the capabilities of its industrial methodology&#xD;
      then aided in the development of its future business. Specifically, the&#xD;
      credibility provided by Halliday's report enabled the company to&#xD;
      substantiate its claims to customers. FMS went on to make two&#xD;
      successful TSB funding applications and in 2012 it was shortlisted for an&#xD;
      Advanced Manufacturing Award [A]. Beneficiaries from this impact are FMS
          and its customers.&#xD;
    ZBD Displays is a Malvern-based technology company which was spun&#xD;
      out from QinetiQ in 2000 [B]. Its core business is based on a&#xD;
      specialist LCD technology - a very-low-energy display requiring no battery&#xD;
      power to retain its image - which it has successfully directed towards the&#xD;
      niche market of shelf-edge labelling for retail. As a small company with&#xD;
      limited funds or staff time for R&amp;amp;D, ZBD Displays nevertheless&#xD;
      engaged the MERI modelling group on a 24 month (2005-7) DTI- funded&#xD;
      project [vii] to develop a detailed LB nemato-dynamics simulation scheme&#xD;
      and use it to investigate operational details of the ZBD device.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the company fully funded a further 6 months of research and&#xD;
      invested staff time to maintain the collaboration up to publication of a&#xD;
      joint paper in 2010 [3]. Given the company's size and the capabilities of&#xD;
      its staff-base, it would have been impossible for it to undertake such&#xD;
      work other than through partnership with the MERI group. The work&#xD;
      programme for this collaboration was designed to explore potential future&#xD;
      device improvements and, so, enable ZBD Displays to make informed&#xD;
      future strategic decisions. The simulations did, indeed, determine and&#xD;
      quantify potential improvements as well as providing insights into certain&#xD;
      failure mechanisms. However, the enhancements identified were ultimately&#xD;
      judged insufficient to warrant disruption of a working production process.&#xD;
      The key impact of MERI's interaction with ZBD Displays was,&#xD;
      therefore, that it provided the company with unambiguous "capability&#xD;
      limits" for its device hardware. This contributed to a fundamental shift&#xD;
      in the company's focus from its hardware origins to systems processes and&#xD;
      software [C]. ZBD Displays has thrived since its 2006-10&#xD;
      collaboration with MERI - in 2012 it achieved sales of &amp;#163;12m, was ranked 5th&#xD;
      in the Sunday Times League Table of the UK's fastest growing technology&#xD;
      firms, and named top of the Deloitte Fast 50 technology firms following&#xD;
      5-year growth of 17910% [B]. Beneficiaries from this impact are ZBD&#xD;
          Displays, their share-holders and customers.&#xD;
    In 2007-08, the MERI modelling group worked with Kodak's then&#xD;
      European Research Lab in Cambridge to study an ink-droplet dispenser&#xD;
      module developed to enhance the capabilities of high- speed digital&#xD;
      printers [xii]. Kodak had a pre-existing patent on this module&#xD;
      [D], but had identified a requirement for specialist simulation work to&#xD;
      determine key operational processes and design parameters. Experimentally,&#xD;
      the geometry of this module had been shown to achieve consistent droplet&#xD;
      size uniformity, but ambiguities persisted regarding the underlying&#xD;
      physics. Therefore, in a study led by Care, LB simulations of multiple&#xD;
      droplet flow were performed using MERI's immiscible fluid algorithms [6]&#xD;
      in Kodak's module geometry. This succeeded in identifying the key&#xD;
      droplet pinch mechanism [E] and, thus, the module's main design&#xD;
      parameters. In particular it confirmed that there was a sound basis for&#xD;
      the observed droplet uniformity. Whilst Kodak underwent global&#xD;
      restructuring subsequent to this intervention, the relevant patent&#xD;
      remained active because (i) as part of Kodak's core printing&#xD;
      portfolio it was retained during chapter 11 proceedings and (ii) the&#xD;
      module's inventors (the Kodak employees who had worked with Care)&#xD;
      negotiated rights to exploit the device outside of printing through a new&#xD;
      spin-out Imbrys. Additionally, subsequent work on the module,&#xD;
      involving the same inventors, elicited a new patent filing on a different&#xD;
      feature of the droplet module [E]. Beneficiaries from the improved device&#xD;
      understanding achieved here are, then, Kodak and Imbrys,&#xD;
      through their ongoing patent interests in [D].&#xD;
    As well as working with a range of industrial groups, the MERI modelling&#xD;
      group also has a track record of achieving uptake of its simulation&#xD;
      algorithms by other modelling professionals. Direct uptake&#xD;
      includes that by modellers at Kodak (USA) and Petrobras&#xD;
      (Brazil) who have utilised the MERI group's LB algorithms to simulate&#xD;
      industrially-relevant systems. The former, which started through a direct&#xD;
      email query, has developed into an extended interaction [F]. More&#xD;
      systematically, the group has also contributed actively to the development&#xD;
      DL_MESO a commercially-available simulation package developed and&#xD;
      disseminated by the Computational Science Group at the STFC Daresbury&#xD;
      laboratory [G]. Specifically, Care and Halliday have been advisory panel&#xD;
      members for DL_MESO and the LB routines which comprise the bulk of&#xD;
      DL_MESO, including the multi-component schemes for both "dipahsic" and&#xD;
      many mutually immiscible fluids are, essentially, those developed in&#xD;
      references [5,6]. Downloads of the DL_MESO software in the REF impact&#xD;
      window total 637, of which 574 were from outside the UK [H]. Beneficiaries&#xD;
      from this work include relevant sections of STFC Daresbury&#xD;
      and their sponsors, due to the associated enhancements to their&#xD;
      product, as well as materials simulation professionals gaining&#xD;
      access to MERI-devised algorithms (either directly or through DL_MESO) and&#xD;
      applying them in a non- academic context.&#xD;
    The final impact achieved by the MERI modelling group relates to PUS&#xD;
      activities undertaken by Cleaver. In collaboration with partners from the&#xD;
      Universities of Manchester, Southampton and York and Sharp Labs Europe,&#xD;
      under the auspices of the British Liquid Crystal Society, Cleaver&#xD;
      developed and presented LC simulation material for the PUS stand "Liquid&#xD;
      Crystals: Living Cells and Flat Screen TVs" at the Royal Society&#xD;
      tri-centennial Summer Science Exhibition (July 2010) [J]. As well as&#xD;
      simulation-based display items and information sheets for teachers,&#xD;
      Cleaver developed a live interactive computer simulation application for&#xD;
      the event. The PUS stand was presented to Her Majesty the Queen, David&#xD;
      Willets MP, and many other dignitaries and Fellows of the Royal Society at&#xD;
      the Exhibition's opening event [J]. Over the following three weeks, the&#xD;
      event, which occupied the ground floor exhibition space of London's&#xD;
      Festival Hall, was attended by thousands of members of the public and&#xD;
      school groups, with over 2000 specifically visiting the LC stand. The&#xD;
      Royal Society gave a positive evaluation to Cleaver's stand and&#xD;
      subsequently nominated it for inclusion in the 30,000 footfall Big Bang&#xD;
      event (March 2011, Excel Arena, London). In this shorter, but larger,&#xD;
      event, a slightly revised version of the original stand was presented and&#xD;
      included in a Royal-Society-coordinated Family Tour called "Specially&#xD;
      Selected". Big Bang evaluated the LC stand as "Excellent" [K]. Follow&#xD;
      through on the events delivered in 2010 and '11 included write-ups in&#xD;
      'Liquid Crystals Today' and conference presentations. These were picked up&#xD;
      in the 'Routes to Impact' sections of several RCUK applications and&#xD;
      explicitly led to, for example, development of a PUS stand at Big Bang&#xD;
      Scotland 2013 from Strathclyde University. Additionally, resources&#xD;
      developed were shared with other PUS providers globally. For example,&#xD;
      Cleaver's live interactive computer simulation application was posted on&#xD;
      the high profile NSF-funded Soft Matter World website [L] where it has&#xD;
      achieved downloads from 5 continents of ~80 per month. Beneficiaries of&#xD;
      this impact were the Royal Society and Big Bang 2011; school
        groups who visited the stand (as independently evaluated by the&#xD;
      Royal Society and Big Bang); and family groups who engaged in, for&#xD;
      example, the "Specially Selected" Royal Society Family Tour.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Fluid modelling approaches devised by the Materials and Engineering&#xD;
      Research Institute's (MERI's) materials and fluid flow modelling group&#xD;
      have impacted on industrial partners, research professionals&#xD;
      and outreach recipients. This case study focuses on economic&#xD;
        impacts arising from improved understanding which this modelling&#xD;
      work has given of commercial products and processes. These include: metal&#xD;
      particulate decontamination methods developed by the UK small company Fluid
        Maintenance Solutions; liquid crystal devices (LCDs) manufactured by&#xD;
      the UK SME ZBD Displays; and an ink-droplet dispenser module&#xD;
      originally invented at the multinational Kodak. Additionally, the&#xD;
      modelling group's computer simulation algorithms have been adopted by&#xD;
        industrial research professionals and made available via STFC&#xD;
        Daresbury's internationally distributed software package DL_MESO.&#xD;
      Finally, the group has developed, presented and disseminated&#xD;

    Materials modelling has been a continuous element in MERI's research&#xD;
      activity through the work of Care (1988-2012), Halliday (1985-present) and&#xD;
      Cleaver (1994-present). Particular areas of specialisation have been:&#xD;
      coarse-grained molecular simulation of ordered fluids; Lattice Boltzmann&#xD;
      (LB) simulation of multi-component fluids; and mesoscopic modelling of&#xD;
      liquid crystals (LCs). As set out below, much of this work has been&#xD;
      undertaken in collaboration with industrial partners.&#xD;
    The simulation methodologies developed by the MERI modelling group over&#xD;
      the last ~20 years represent an unrivalled suite of modelling tools for&#xD;
      LCD design and optimisation: no other group in the world can offer&#xD;
      molecular, coarse-grained, LB and mesh-free modelling of LCs. The group's&#xD;
      standing in this field originates from the period 1994-2002 when, in&#xD;
      collaboration with the then Displays and Devices group at DERA/QinetiQ&#xD;
      in Malvern, Care and Cleaver led a series of research projects relating to&#xD;
      molecular and mesoscopic computer simulation of LC behaviour. This&#xD;
      comprised four PhD projects partially supported by DERA/QinetiQ&#xD;
      [i] and one by EPSRC [ii], and included innovations on the modelling of,&#xD;
      for instance, LC mixtures [1] and tilted smectic phases. Within this&#xD;
      collaboration, Cleaver and Care, working with senior scientists from DERA/QinetiQ,&#xD;
      identified an industrial need for a methodology capable of modelling the&#xD;
      switching behaviour of LCDs. This triggered two projects (1998-2002) with&#xD;
      DERA/QinetiQ within which a generalised LB simulation&#xD;
      approach for LCs was developed [2]. This also built on Halliday's previous&#xD;
      expertise on LB modelling of isotropic fluids (see below). The first of&#xD;
      these projects [iii] concentrated on a director-based LB model. The second&#xD;
      [iv], which focused on a prototype display device then being developed by&#xD;
      QinetiQ, prompted the development of algorithms for a more&#xD;
      comprehensive Qian- Shen Q-matrix description of LB nemato-dynamics [2].&#xD;
      This was particularly progressive since it aligned the simulations with&#xD;
      the continuum descriptions employed by QinetiQ's LCD designers.&#xD;
      Equipped with this designer-oriented technology, the MERI modelling group&#xD;
      secured EPSRC support [v] and a significant research contract with SEIKO-Epson&#xD;
      (2001-3) to develop, evaluate and document a mesoscopic LCD simulator&#xD;
      [vi]. However, SEIKO-Epson would not disclose its motivations or&#xD;
      intended usage of this simulator, so any impact arising from [vi] remains&#xD;
      uncaptured.&#xD;
    As documented in section 4, Care went on to lead a DTI-supported&#xD;
      [vii] project (2005-08) with ZBD Displays, an SME which had been&#xD;
      spun out from QinetiQ. This required the modelling group's LB&#xD;
      nemato-dynamics methods to be extended to incorporate realistic&#xD;
      representations of electromagnetism, dielectric inhomogeneity and complex&#xD;
      boundaries. The result was the first full device solver capable of&#xD;
      modelling the switching behaviour of a LCD [3]. Further innovations led by&#xD;
      Cleaver (2004-09) included simulations of LC anchoring at patterned&#xD;
      substrates [viii], which led to a joint publication with Sharp Labs&#xD;
        Europe, and the development of a fundamentally different "mesh-free"&#xD;
      approach for LCD modelling based on inherently multi-scale Modified Smooth&#xD;
      Particle Hydrodynamics methods. This approach was rolled out and tested in&#xD;
      an industrial context in 2009 through a collaboration with Hewlett-Packard
        Labs, Bristol [4,ix].&#xD;
    In parallel with their developments on LC modelling, from 1997 the MERI&#xD;
      modelling group also established an expertise in LB simulation of&#xD;
      isotropic fluids, particularly immiscible multiphase- flows. Here, using&#xD;
      support from both industry [x-xii] and research councils [v,xiii] Care and&#xD;
      Halliday focussed on the development of mathematical descriptions and&#xD;
      simulation algorithms for fluid-fluid interfaces [5]. Achieving more&#xD;
      singular and isotropic representations of these interfaces enabled&#xD;
      descriptions of model systems whereby deformable particles suspended in an&#xD;
      ambient fluid were represented as multiple immiscible droplets. The&#xD;
      resultant algorithms subsequently found application in simulation of a&#xD;
      range of complex flows involving high-volume-fraction suspensions [6]. In&#xD;
      the context of engineering flows, this led to collaborative projects with:&#xD;
      BNFL on radioactive sludges; Rolls Royce Associates on&#xD;
      thermal fluids [x]; Fluent on algorithm refinement [xi]; Cadbury&#xD;
      on food systems; and Kodak on ink droplet formation [xii]. The&#xD;
      developments made with Fluent went on to form the basis of a collaboration&#xD;
      on haemodynamics with Harvard Medical School and another on biofluid flows&#xD;
      with UK experimental groups [xiii]. The modelling group's LB expertise was&#xD;
      also used in Knowledge Transfer interventions with Fluid Maintenance&#xD;
        Solutions and Nestl&amp;#233;.&#xD;

    We now provide evidence to show that the research findings that we have&#xD;
      cited in 3.1 and 3.2 have resulted in two major impacts:&#xD;
    (1) the design and production of a new generation of sound barrier for a&#xD;
      wide range of industrial and business partners, a number of them leaders&#xD;
      in their field. These sound barriers not only provide commercial and&#xD;
      operational benefit for these companies but they additionally provide&#xD;
      improved environmental benefit (reduced sound transmission) and reduced&#xD;
      cost in compliance with EU Regulations. A spin-out company (Sonobex) has&#xD;
      been established to test and market these designs and products&#xD;
    (2) a contribution to the understanding of science and engineering to&#xD;
      both the public and to policy makers, via Sonobex.&#xD;
    Impact 1&#xD;
    The outcome from the research is in the commercialisation stage and the&#xD;
      research grants listed in section 3 have been awarded in order to develop&#xD;
      commercial products based on the academic research carried out in&#xD;
      2007-2012 [3.1, 3.2]. A spin-out company Sonobex&#xD;
      Ltd. was formed in May 2013 and prototype sound barriers have been&#xD;
      successfully tested. The list of project partners given below is evidence&#xD;
      that Sonobex Ltd has established its visibility and is set&#xD;
      to realise its potential in both UK and international markets. Because of&#xD;
      the damaging effects of noise on public health and&#xD;
      the environment, European Legislation [The European&#xD;
      Parliament and The Council of The European Union, Directive&#xD;
      2002/49/18.7.2002.] for noise has required each member state to prepare&#xD;
      noise maps of larger towns and cities and to publish action plans that&#xD;
      identify noise standards and set out programmes to reduce levels to these&#xD;
      standards. The first UK round of noise mapping has been completed (2011)&#xD;
      and the second round of noise mapping is taking place. A follow on&#xD;
      regulation to the Environment Noise (England) regulations, 2006 will&#xD;
      require reductions in noise limits to take effect from 2016. The noise&#xD;
      which is predominately of concern is airborne sound and the Loughborough&#xD;
      University research and development of air sound barriers with their&#xD;
      advantages as outlined in Section 2 has led to interest from a wide&#xD;
      variety of major construction firms. As such the solutions provided by&#xD;
      Sonobex Ltd, based on the research conducted within the Unit, is&#xD;
      contributing to the implementation of public policy and improved
          public services.&#xD;
    Current business partners, attracted to the technology because of its&#xD;
      potential for improved public health and quality
          of life, include:&#xD;
    &#xD;

        to a roll out in the French rail transport infrastructure.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    The range of designs and products include:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Production of enclosures for use around noisy machinery in factories,&#xD;
        air conditioning systems, road drills etc.- the Alkane Energy prototype&#xD;
        and the "Major Power Infrastructure Company" order are of this type [5.1,
          5.2].
&#xD;
      Sound barriers for use along motorways and railways with reduced wind&#xD;
        loading, improved drainage and visual impact &amp;#8212; East Midlands Trains&#xD;

    Impact 2&#xD;
    Loughborough's spin out, Sonobex has featured on national radio (BBC&#xD;
      Radio 4's PM show) and newspaper (The Times, Innovation &amp;amp; Growth&#xD;
      supplement) as well as in more specialist outlets (The Engineer magazine&#xD;
      and a cover article in Innovation &amp;amp; Research Focus). Sonobex and the&#xD;
      BBC have agreed production of a feature in the The One Show for 2014. This&#xD;
      provides further evidence of an on-going commitment to public engagement.&#xD;
      In addition, for his work on sound barrier technology, Elford won a Bronze&#xD;
      award from the Parliamentary &amp;amp; Scientific Committee at the Houses of&#xD;
      Commons research competition &amp;#8212; SET for Britain. Sonobex has&#xD;
      therefore made a contribution to the understanding of science and&#xD;
          engineering to both the public and to policy
          makers.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Sound pollution, which harms quality of life and health&#xD;
      (e.g. hearing loss, hypertension and heart disease), is a subject of&#xD;
      public concern and legislation. Research at Loughborough University has&#xD;
      led to the design and production of a new generation of sound&#xD;
          barrier for a wide range of industrial and business partners,&#xD;
      a number of them leaders in their field. These sound barriers provide&#xD;
      improved environmental benefit and reduced cost&#xD;
      in compliance with EU Regulations. A spin-out&#xD;
      company (Sonobex) has been established to test and market these designs&#xD;
      and products. Outreach by Sonobex through the media and at the Houses of&#xD;
      Commons has led to a contribution to the understanding of science&#xD;
          and engineering to both the public and to policy
          makers.&#xD;

    Noise barriers are used to reduce noise disturbance from industrial&#xD;
      plant, roads, railways etc. Traditionally outdoor noise barriers are&#xD;
      constructed from solid structures (concrete walls etc.) which act both to&#xD;
      absorb the sound and also, by reflection, to deflect it away from the&#xD;
      areas that require protection. Whilst these traditional methods can be&#xD;
      very effective they generally suffer from the major disadvantage of&#xD;
      preventing the free flow of air and light through the barrier. Recent&#xD;
      years have seen a growing interest in the potential for use of sonic&#xD;
      crystals &amp;#8212; arrays of cylindrical rods &amp;#8212; as noise barriers. An advantage of&#xD;
      sonic crystals (SCs) is that by varying the distance between the rods it&#xD;
      is possible to attain peaks of attenuation in a selected range of&#xD;
      frequencies.&#xD;
    A further advantage of an SC barrier in comparison to more traditional&#xD;
      sound barriers are its ability to allow light to pass and, uniquely, that&#xD;
      it does not present an obstruction to the free flow of air. However,&#xD;
      barriers using `conventional' SCs suffer from the major disadvantage of&#xD;
      providing attenuation only over a rather narrow frequency band (and&#xD;
      harmonics thereof) and are therefore unsuitable as barriers to broad band&#xD;
      sound.&#xD;
    The concept of using Locally Resonant Sonic Crystals (LRSC) in which the&#xD;
      cylinders in the array act individually as resonators whose frequency&#xD;
      differs from that of the array helps to alleviate this problem but broad&#xD;
      band attenuation is still not achieved. Experimental and modelling work&#xD;
      carried out in the Loughborough University Physics Department by research&#xD;
      students and latterly postdoctoral researchers Dan Elford and Luke&#xD;
      Chalmers (2007-2013) under the joint supervision of Prof. Kusmartsev (Head&#xD;
      of Department, staff member 1990 to date) and Dr. Swallowe (Senior&#xD;
      Lecturer, staff member 1984 to date) [3.1, 3.2] in which the use&#xD;
      of multiple active Helmholtz resonators as scattering elements was&#xD;
      investigated has shown that carefully designed LRSCs can provide&#xD;
      attenuation well in excess of that provided by normal `mass law'&#xD;
      attenuators and in broader frequency ranges than conventional LRSCs.&#xD;
    The key aspects of the research outcomes and the potential impact are&#xD;
      that with LRSC systems attenuation is as good as with conventional&#xD;
      barriers but&#xD;
    1) In all situations a flow of air and light is possible &amp;#8212; thus systems&#xD;
      such as industrial compressors can be acoustically shielded without being&#xD;
      enclosed. This is a major advantage since air flow is required to provide&#xD;
      cooling [3.1, 3.2]&#xD;
    2) LRSCs can be manufactured from a very wide range of materials and can&#xD;
      be used to architecturally enhance the appearance of a building while&#xD;
      providing (when used as a window covering) shade from direct sunlight and&#xD;
      attenuation of exterior sound along with a free flow of cool air [3.1,&#xD;
        3.2]&#xD;
    3) Conventional sound barriers for outdoor use (e.g. along motorways in&#xD;
      residential areas) are intermittently subjected to very considerable wind&#xD;
      loading resulting in the need for massive supports. The wind permeability&#xD;
      of LRSC barriers considerably alleviates this requirement [3.1, 3.2]&#xD;
    4) Barriers can attenuate at low acoustic frequencies without the need to&#xD;
      satisfy the mass law. [3.1, 3.2]&#xD;
    The work is protected by GB and international patents [3.3, 3.4, 3.5,&#xD;

    As clearly and specifically described in the comprehensive STFC 2008
      publication The Social &amp;amp; Economic Impact of the Daresbury SRS,
      the impact of central facilities has not been restricted to the science
      itself. This publication states that "Impacts from the SRS include the
      creation of knowledge, improved quality of life in the UK, the generation
      and transfer of skills, improved competitiveness of industry, the
      commercialisation of technology, financial effects and the creation of
      jobs." The input of many Keele staff to central facilities, particularly
      the SRS and the ILL, has been in instrumentation, techniques, support, and
      training, each of which impacts significantly at many economic and social
      levels. This publication also highlights the impact of Joint appointments
      as an important aspect of the skills exchange between the SRS and host
      Universities and in bringing. science drivers and challenges to the SRS
      from the Universities. Keele University was central to this exchange,
      providing a series of academics as joint appointments (including Greenhough,
        Glover, Greenall, Stirling, Catlow, Fitch) from the first days in
      1981 through to closure of the SRS in 2008.
    The 2007 Research Councils UK report by PA consulting, "Study
          on the economic impact of the Research Councils" has a section
      specifically devoted to the impact of Protein Crystallography (PX) at the
      SRS, where Keele led from day 1 through several Joint appointments and
      subsequently Keele PhD students who moved to positions there and elsewhere
      following graduation. "At the heart of Central Facilities are the
      development scientists and the user support staff, forming a focus for
      serving and training a vast community of engineers, scientists, academics
      and pharmaceutical companies." The report details examples of the
      contribution of PX at the SRS to drug discovery, citing the enzyme purine
      nucleoside phosphorylase (teams from Alabama and Keele including Greenhough)
      which provided a starting point to design new drugs to target diseases
      such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's
      disease, one of which underwent clinical trial and was licensed to a major
      pharmaceutical company. The report adds that commercial users of the PX
      facilities included 16 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as
      AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Astex Therapeutics.
    The impact that Keele continues to have through Central Facilities and
      current (Forsyth, Teixeira, Greenhough, Sule-Suso, Telling) past
      (for example Myles, Langan) and future Keele researchers
      (currently 12 Keele PhD students are engaged in projects utilising
      Diamond, ILL, the ESRF, APS, SOLEIL) is huge. The RCUK report by PA
      confirms this by showing that "Structural biology and the way it is done
      now would not be possible without the SRS and the subsequent development
      of other sources. Difficult proteins would not have been solved without
      the improvements in technology and the speed of crystallographic structure
      determination would be prohibitive." This applies to the human C-reactive
      protein structure, a landmark work in 1996 led by two still current Keele
      staff (Shrive, Greenhough) and made possible by the SRS
      following some 50 years of effort world wide. Cited 190 times, it
      continues to underline the impact of basic science on medical practice,
      underpinned by widespread publicity ranging from blanket GP circulars
      (print and video) to Newsweek. This raised awareness, and the scientific
      work itself, has contributed significantly to the subsequent debate
      surrounding the molecule and its role in CVD and to the increased
      importance of raised levels in the clinical setting, particularly for
      at-risk patients. The RCUK report by PA also confirms that
      "the ribosome structure, a fundamental scientific breakthrough which may
      lend itself to drug discovery, relied heavily on the ability to rapidly
      screen crystals at the SRS". This screening was carried out on stations
      developed and supported by Keele staff.
    While closure of the SRS in 2008 ended almost 30 years of pivotal Keele
      involvement in the support, training and achievements of many thousands of
      Daresbury users, with lasting impact on the "scientific, industrial and
      skill base of the UK", the Keele impact then accelerated through leading
      roles in the establishment of the next generation of central facilities
      with many continuing to play key roles in training, advising and
      transferring key skills and technology to these facilities. The subsequent
      and current senior roles at these new facilities continue to impact on a
      global scale.
    Keele has played, and continues to play through Forsyth and Teixeira,
      a major role in the development, support and exploitation of neutron
      scattering for the study of biological molecules and industrial materials,
      impacting particularly on the pharmaceutical and polymer industries and
      the training of the next generation of scientists with diverse and
      essential skills for the workplace. The 2012 STFC report on Neutron
      scattering Materials research for modern life (STFC, 2012)
      gives examples of the significant medical, social and economic impact that
      neutron scattering science contributes to our lives, with the study of
      biological molecules enabling "Multidisciplinary teams of medics,
      physicists, materials scientists, chemists and engineers to come together
      to make key breakthroughs in using materials in medicine". Much of this
      work has been made possible through the input and expertise of Keele
      staff. Major awards of over &amp;#163;2m to Forsyth and Fuller with
      a variety of collaborators provided the funding to develop the facilities
      and construct "A Laboratory to support the Deuteration of Biological
      Macromolecules" (Led by Forsyth in collaboration with Myles,
      then at EMBL) as outlined in the ILL Millenium Programme proposal
          of 2001. In January 2003, Business, the
      quarterly magazine of the BBSRC, included reference to the major Keele-led
      developments in progress at the ILL which will "mean that biologists can
      contemplate experiments that were simply impossible previously", while the
      EPSRC Newsline reported that a key aim of the facility was
      to "develop and train the UK user base" for these techniques.
    In 2013 the Report from the ILL Associates' Working Group on
          Neutrons in Europe for 2025 concluded that neutrons will
      remain an essential tool for science and industry including not only
      materials science but also the environment, life sciences and information
      technology. "Some two thirds of neutron scattering studies contribute
      directly to or closely underpin the needs of industry". Keele, through Forsyth
      and Teixeira, and the next generation of Central Facility experts
      currently being trained as PhD students between Keele and the ILL, will
      continue to play a pivotal role in delivering and exploiting this science
      and enabling the accompanying economic and social impact.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Keele University has made sustained and seminal contributions to the
      development and use of central facilities (Synchrotron radiation, Neutron
      scattering) which started over 30 years ago and are still in progress
      today. Past and present academics at all levels from Keele who began this
      work have gone on not only to carry out their own ground breaking research
      using these facilities but, in many cases, to have a major social,
      economic and industrial impact, through key roles in development, support
      and techniques and through the present, current and next generation of
      scientific, management and technical expertise at Central Facilities
      around the world. This includes numerous postgraduate students, Research
      Associates and academic staff. The contribution to Science and Technology
      has enabled significant breakthroughs in many aspects of science and
      medicine, accompanied by direct economic and social impact and a unique
      and ongoing contribution to the current generation of SR and neutron
      sources, their scientific staff and their users.

    This case study is based on the seminal contribution made by Keele
      University staff to the ongoing development, support, management, use and
      world-wide exploitation of Central Facilities. The impact was and
      continues to be enormous for those who exploit Central Facilities for
      scientific, technical and commercially motivated research across the
      physical and life sciences. Over thirty years ago in the then Department
      of Physics at Keele, Watson Fuller and John Helliwell (who
      went on to play a pivotal role in not only methods development but also
      management and Leadership, for example as CCLRC Director of SR Science
      based at Daresbury (2002); President of the European Crystallographic
      Association (2006-2009); Editor in Chief Acta Crystallographica
      (1996-2005)) were central to the development of the dedicated Synchrotron
      Radiation Source (SRS) at Daresbury for protein crystallography, fibre
      diffraction and small angle scattering for the investigation of molecular
      structure and organization in a wide range of naturally occurring and
      synthetic materials. Later developments included Magnetic Scattering led
      by Keele Professor Bill Stirling (1987-1995) who went on to be
      Director General of the ESRF (1999-2008), and Andy Fitch (Keele
      Staff 1986-1998) who was central to the development of powder diffraction
      facilities at the SRS and now leads at the ESRF through beam line ID31.
      Early names at the PG/RA level include Trevor Greenhough, who went
      on to spend many years as a central figure in the development of Protein
      crystallography facilities and applications at Daresbury (1986-1997),
      including Lead of the EPSRC supported UK 7.2 CRG (1994-1997), Ian Glover
      (1990 &amp;#8212; 1998) who led the development of station 9.5 and anomalous
      dispersion and diffuse scattering applications at Daresbury, and Trevor Forsyth
      who played a similar role in SR Fibre diffraction (1989-1998) and has gone
      on to make further major and continuing contributions in neutron
      scattering at the ILL, Grenoble (1998 &amp;#8212; current).
    Keele Postgraduate students whose input continues to impact
      internationally include Dean Myles (PhD awarded 1992) initially
      PDRA at Keele (1989-1996) with particular responsibility for station 7.2;
      then Staff Scientist EMBL Grenoble and Station Scientist ILL Grenoble and
      currently Director, Neutron Scattering Sciences Division at Oak Ridge
      National Laboratory USA), Annette Shrive (PhD awarded 1991) who
      played a key role in developing the SR Laue technique (1988-1999) and is
      now on the academic staff at Keele (1999 &amp;#8212; current), Paul Langan
      (PhD awarded 1990), initially beamline scientist at ILL (1994-1998) and
      now Team Leader of the Proteomics and Neutron Protein Crystallography team

    Context: Dental decay is the most common of all diseases
      (prevalence: ~10% of the population p.a. in the western world i.e. 100
      million lesions p.a.), yet the principles of treatment have remained
      unchanged for almost 100 years (J. Dent. 2003, 31,
      395-405). Most adults worldwide suffer from dental caries (tooth decay),
      many of which go untreated because of patients' fear of the dental drill.
      The earliest sign of tooth decay is the "white spot" lesion, visible to
      the clinician on the tooth surface. There is no current consensus view
      regarding treatment, and clinicians have three choices: (a) to monitor the
      lesion, and then to excavate and fill; (b) to apply fluoride treatments,
      and then to proceed as in (a); and (c) to place a small restoration.
      Ultimately, all restorations fail and need to be replaced with larger
      fillings, and will eventually lead to tooth loss and replacement.
      Treatment currently costs the UK NHS ca &amp;#163;2bn pa (roughly half the
      budget for dental care; Office of the Government Auditor). Drilling is
      feared by many patients, inhibiting their attendance at the dentist and so
      precluding opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment of decay as
      well as diseases such as oral cancer. Leeds' self-assembling peptide
      technology provides a simple and cost-effective alternative to current
      treatments that avoids a subsequent need for larger fillings; this
      technology removes the clinician's dilemma of whether to treat decay, and
      removes the need for drilling and thus the fear of visiting the dentist.
    Societal impact
      Public interest was stimulated through promotional material from
      EPSRC; in a story featuring Prof. Kirkham on Channel 4 News; and in an
      article in the Daily Mail (A).
    Economic impacts
      A company was established ("Credentis AG", Switzerland;
      www.credentis.com) in January 2010, in which the University of Leeds is a
      major stakeholder, to exploit under license Leeds' IP on self- assembling
      peptides in the dental domain (B,C). Jobs have been created for
      highly-skilled researchers at both Credentis in Switzerland (2010, 0.5
      FTEs; 2011, 2 FTEs; 2012, 3 FTEs; 2013, 4 FTEs) and at the University of
      Leeds (3 FTEs in 2013) (C). In its first two years of operation, the
      company has raised external investment of ca 4.75M Swiss
      francs (ca &amp;#163;3M) in three rounds (2010, 0.25M CHF; 2011, 2.5M CHF;
      2013, 2.0M CHF) (C).
    Leeds' IP has enabled the adoption of disruptive technology
      within dental care. The platform technology for self assembling peptide
      design developed in Leeds was patented (D, currently maintained), and
      underpins diverse applications including the design of biomimetic
      scaffolds in tissue engineering. Following Leeds research using self
      assembling peptide technology to treat decay lesions in extracted teeth,
      an applications patent was granted in 2009 (E) and is currently
      maintained. Subsequent Leeds research comparing the ability of different
      peptide designs to nucleate mineral crystals and to regenerate bone led to
      the filing of a patent in the US (F).
    Credentis was recognised as one of the top 100 Swiss start-up companies
      in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (http://www.startup.ch/index.cfm?CFID=241786181&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=45081364&amp;amp;page=129572&amp;amp;profilesEntr
        y=1) by a panel of start-up company experts in conjunction with
      Handelszeitung. In 2012, Credentis opened at UK office in Leeds,
      reflecting the continuing close collaboration with researchers in the
      University. Support for this collaborative research programme includes a
      new &amp;#163;1.2M award via the Leeds EPSRC Medical Technologies Innovation and
      Knowledge Centre (EP/I019103/1) to develop second-generation peptides for
      further dental applications to increase the Credentis product range (G).
      Leeds researchers (Aggeli, Kirkham) are developing new technology and
      minimising commercial risk via the provision of access to a full and
      validated pipeline screening facility including (a) rational peptide
      design; (b) characterisation of self-assembly processes; (c) computational
      modelling; (d) theology testing; (e) screening for capacity to induce
      mineralisation; (f) cytotoxicity testing; (g) in situ (ex vivo)
      testing; (h) clinical trials; and (i) process development.
    A new product (initially CurodontTM, and now CurodontTM
        Repair (H)) containing peptide P11-4, based on patents of Leeds
      researchers, was granted its CE certificate in January 2012 (C) and has
      now entered the European market for clinical use as a class IIa medical
      device; the product has also been approved for clinical use in Australia,
      and Health Canada approval is pending. Large scale production of CurodontTM
        provides a fully GMP-compliant product (50,000 patient treatments
      in the first run) for which patient acceptability has been shown to be
      very high. Leeds researchers contributed to this outcome by conducting
      first in man safety trials for P11-4, demonstrating a clear clinical
      improvement over treatment of class 5 lesions with the peptide (6). The
      product has been launched in Germany and Switzerland in Q1/2013. Credentis
      has engaged a UK dental specialist company, Optident, who will distribute
      and supply the products within the UK market from October 2013 (I). A
      second product, Curodont&amp;#8482; Protect, was approved(H) in April 2013, is
      regulated as a cosmetic and has been launched in selected markets in 2013;
      here, the formulation of the peptide has been adapted for the treatment of
      dentin hypersensitivity and the prevention of tooth decay.
    There has been significant investment in research and development
      of this peptide technology (including P11-4) by overseas industry. In
      addition to support from Credentis AG (G), a collaborative project with
      Geistlich Biomaterials (Switzerland) demonstrated that self-assembling
      peptides can promote highly efficient bone regeneration in an animal
      model.
    Health impact
      A new clinical intervention - a medical device for restoration of
      early enamel caries - has been developed, trialled in patients and a
      definite positive outcome demonstrated (6). Leeds researchers were
      involved in all stages of the product development from laboratory to
      chairside (C). The resulting marketed products launched in 2013 are seen
      by the profession to fill the previously unfilled gap between prevention
      and surgical intervention (J).
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    A new class of synthetic self-assembling peptides has been developed at
      Leeds into a product that allows the enamel in the dental cavities to be
      regenerated. The peptides assemble to form gels that have been shown to be
      promising biocompatible materials with applications in regenerative
      medicine, for example in the regeneration of bone. Credentis AG
      (Switzerland) was founded in January 2010 to commercialise the technology
      in the dental care domain. Its first product Curodont&amp;#8482; Repair - the first
      product of its kind in dental care - has completed first-in-man safety
      trials (also at Leeds); has received regulatory approval for clinical use
      in Switzerland, Europe and Australia; and was launched in Switzerland and
      Germany in Q1/2013. The product has tremendous promise because most adults
      suffer from dental caries which often go untreated because of patients'
      fear of the dental drill. A second product Curodont&amp;#8482; Protect, approved in
      April 2013 and regulated as a cosmetic, has been launched in 2013 for the
      treatment of dentin hypersensitivity. Credentis has established a UK base
      in Leeds and has engaged a UK company as distributor of its products from
      October 2013.

    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Chemistry</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    This new regenerative therapy for the treatment of early enamel decay
      developed from an interdisciplinary, collaborative research programme at
      the University of Leeds led by Aggeli (School of Chemistry and
      Centre for Self-Organising Molecular Systems, SOMS/Centre for Molecular
      Nanoscience, CMNS) and Kirkham (Leeds Dental Institute).
    The initial underpinning research formed part of a major programme on
      peptide self-assembly within the SOMS Centre at Leeds led by Boden.
      In 1995, Aggeli, then a PhD student in the School of Chemistry at Leeds
      supervised by Boden, described for the first time the ability of peptides
      to aggregate to form supramolecular nanotapes and gels (A. Aggeli, Spectroscopic
        studies of self-assembling peptides in solution and in lipid bilayers,
      PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 1995). Subsequently, supported by EPSRC,
      Aggeli and Boden, together with Fishwick, Radford (Faculty of
      Biological Sciences) and McLeish (School of Physics), established (between
      1995 and 2003) the underlying principles required for peptide
      self-assembly into nanotapes and gels (1); a theoretical framework to
      explain the experimental behaviour of self-assembled peptides (2); and the
      principles to design in responsiveness to external triggers in order to
      control the assembly process (3). Under specific conditions, peptides
      undergo hierarchical self-assembly through formation of micrometer-long
      f062-sheet "nanotapes", which stack in pairs to form ribbons, further
      assemble to form fibrils, and then entwine to form fibres. This assembly
      process is principally driven by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
      peptide backbones, together with additional interactions between specific
      backbones, and offered the potential for a new generation of biomaterials
      with many different applications. This research was described in three
      seminal papers(1-3) in high-impact journals that have collectively accrued
      over 1100 citations.
    Kirkham's group [funded from 1998 through Wellcome Trust programme and
      project grants (088908/Z/09/Z) and BBSRC (9709001; ABY08147; REI18424)
      equipment grants] utilised enamel development as a paradigm for
      understanding how extracellular matrix proteins control crystal
      nucleation, disposition and tissue architecture in mammalian
      biomineralisation. This research established the principles that underpin
      the control of crystal growth in developing enamel, leading to the
      hypothesis that domains of negative charge on extracellular matrix
      proteins were responsible for crystal nucleation during enamel
      biomineralisation (4).
    Kirkham and Aggeli's collaboration since 2003 has used the knowledge of
      the structure-function relationships of self-assembling peptides and the
      mechanism of mineralised tissue formation to address clinical challenges
      in dental cavity healing. Peptides were selected that would be monomeric
      at pH &amp;gt;7.5, providing a low viscosity, injectible fluid that would
      spontaneously assemble to form a three-dimensional fibrillar scaffold
      under physiological conditions. In addition, the peptides were designed to
      provide, via their amino acid side chains, domains of negative charge once
      assembled. The resulting three-dimensional structures were therefore
      designed to mimic the biological macromolecules found in extracellular
      matrices of the mammalian skeleton.
    Applied collaborative research between the two groups [funded by an EPSRC
      CASE award, a Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust research award, Leeds' EPSRC
      Medical Technologies Innovation Knowledge Centre (EP/I019103/1) and
      Geistlich Biomaterials, Switzerland] tested the hypotheses that rationally
      designed self assembling synthetic peptides could nucleate mineral
      crystals in vitro and in situ within artificial decay
      lesions in extracted human teeth and were both biocompatible and
      non-allergenic in animals (5). Taking this information together, a
      first-in-man clinical trial (National Research Ethics System project
      number 10/H1207/75) was carried out in 2010 (led by Brunton, Professor of
      Restorative Dentistry, Leeds) applying one of the peptides (P11-4) to
      early enamel decay lesions in patients. The results provided unequivocal
      evidence of efficacy following a single treatment of the lesions with the
      peptide material (6).

      three areas [A]:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      "The selection of appropriate analysis algorithms leading to&#xD;
          improved correlation between&#xD;
          measured parameters and material performance
&#xD;
      Designing and carrying out crystallisation experiments to generate&#xD;
          data for system testing&#xD;
          and validation&#xD;
      
Using the multi-scale image analysis algorithm developed at Leeds&#xD;
          to process the images&#xD;
          obtained in experimentation in order to do further analysis of the&#xD;
          particles such as texture&#xD;
          analysis and classification."&#xD;
    &#xD;
    The first Morphologi G2 was launched at the end of 2005 and was&#xD;
      superseded in September 2007&#xD;
      by the G3.&#xD;
    Impact&#xD;
      The innovative step to which research conducted at the University of Leeds&#xD;
      has contributed has&#xD;
      had a range of impacts during the eligible period on MIL and also on&#xD;
      Morphologi users around the&#xD;
      world in a range of industrial sectors and applications, much of which is&#xD;
      regarded by MIL as&#xD;
      proprietary information. However, public sources of information shows MIL&#xD;
      to have a truly global&#xD;
      outreach with over 50 international subsidiaries and distributors of their&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;
    MIL&#xD;
      Impacts on MIL are both strategic and financial, the Company strengthening&#xD;
      its competitive&#xD;
      advantage in markets around the world and winning significant new business&#xD;
      since 2008:&#xD;
    - Establishing Morphologi as a key product in its portfolio, helped by&#xD;
      extending the range in&#xD;
      October 2012 with the launch of the G3-ID [B], which added chemical&#xD;
      identification of&#xD;
      particles using Raman spectroscopy to the core imaging functionality of&#xD;
      Morphologi&#xD;
    - Generating revenue of nearly &amp;#163;11m from Morphologi since 2008, "leading&#xD;
        to revenues of&#xD;
        &amp;#163;12 million, about 90% of it was generated since January 2008". [A]&#xD;
    -Strengthening its position in all of its important markets (Europe,&#xD;
      USA, Asia and the Far&#xD;
      East) through "increased sales and continued growth worldwide" [A]&#xD;
    - Helping "secure a number of people in employment at Malvern".&#xD;
      [A]&#xD;
    As such Morphologi also contributed to the Queens Award for Enterprise,&#xD;
      International Trade in&#xD;
      2011. [A, G]&#xD;
    Morphologi Users&#xD;
      Morphologi products provide industrial users with critical information&#xD;
      that helps accelerate R&amp;amp;D,&#xD;
      enhance and maintain product quality, and optimise process efficiency.&#xD;
      They are used in both&#xD;
      traditional (e.g. cement) and advanced manufacturing sectors (e.g.&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals) in&#xD;
      applications including:&#xD;
    - Discovery/R&amp;amp;D screening&#xD;
    - Crystallisation engineering&#xD;
    - Formulation development and optimisation&#xD;
    - Process scale-up and optimisation&#xD;
    - Troubleshooting and root cause analysis in manufacturing&#xD;
    - Automation of microscopy methods e.g. detection and enumeration of&#xD;
      foreign particulates&#xD;
    - Validation of quality control particle sizing methods (e.g. laser&#xD;
      diffraction)&#xD;
    Examples of Morphologi's impact on users include the following (note that&#xD;
      quotes in italics are&#xD;
      taken directly from the relevant web pages shown in the corroboration&#xD;
      section that detail the&#xD;
      business advantages these companies experienced since using the&#xD;
      instrument):&#xD;
    - Mo-Sci Corporation (Missouri, USA) regards the Morphologi G3 as&#xD;
      unique, testing&#xD;
      several systems and finding that "while able to characterise our&#xD;
        specialised glass materials&#xD;
        from a size distribution standpoint, other systems couldn't separate out&#xD;
        and identify&#xD;
        individual particles that overlapped within the view of the microscope".&#xD;
      And in terms of&#xD;
      productivity: "During the development of the unique glass beads used in&#xD;
        blood typing cards&#xD;
        (almost half a million glass microspheres per card), it could take three&#xD;
        operators four days&#xD;
        to look at the beads in a single card." "The Morphologi G3 can&#xD;
        accurately measure all the&#xD;
        beads on a card in around 15 minutes, and that includes setting up the&#xD;
        sample. The&#xD;
        measurements themselves take only a few minutes and produce enormous&#xD;
        amounts of&#xD;
        information". [C]&#xD;
    - The Morphologi G3 is used by Solvay Pharmaceuticals (Georgia, USA)&#xD;
      during R&amp;amp;D: "By&#xD;
        analysing shape as well as size, the Morphologi G3...helps us more fully&#xD;
        understand the&#xD;
        materials we are working with and what we can do with them". The&#xD;
      company previously&#xD;
      contracted out much of its particle characterisation work and has&#xD;
      benefited from "shortened&#xD;
        R&amp;amp;D times and much richer data". The R&amp;amp;D team also studies&#xD;
      wet granulation: "Being able&#xD;
        to look at the continuum in terms not only of granule size, but also of&#xD;
        shape was a useful&#xD;
        exercise in determining granule growth". [D]&#xD;
    - Particle Technology Labs (Chicago, USA), a full service&#xD;
      particle characterisation lab,&#xD;
      uses the Morphologi G3 and G3S (G3 with an integrated sample dispersion&#xD;
      unit) to analyse&#xD;
      clients' materials: "Not only has the Morphologi G3 allowed us to move&#xD;
        away from manual&#xD;
        imaging methods, we can now process large numbers of images in many&#xD;
        different ways&#xD;
        and examine a wide variety of parameters to provide more detailed&#xD;
        information and the&#xD;
        extra insight required". [E] The ability to "investigate&#xD;
        sample-to-sample differences or R&amp;amp;D&#xD;
        applications...is very important for a cGMP compliant laboratory with a&#xD;
        primary client base&#xD;
        in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food &amp;amp; beauty industries".&#xD;
      And the G3S "provides&#xD;
        the highest level of automation, and the greatest variety of measurement&#xD;
        parameters". [F]&#xD;
    As one of MIL's "key products" [A] the success of this innovative&#xD;
      range of instruments has made an&#xD;
      obvious contribution toward MIL being awarded the prestigious Queen's&#xD;
      Award for Enterprise:&#xD;
      International Trade 2011 [G]. This award adds significantly to the&#xD;
      national and international&#xD;
      reputation of MIL, to pursue excellence within its business sector.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Research into on-line control of crystallisation at the University of&#xD;
      Leeds started in 2002 which led&#xD;
      to a collaboration being formed with Malvern Instruments Ltd (MIL) in 2006&#xD;
      and subsequently to&#xD;
      the development of a new type of instrument capable of measuring particle&#xD;
      shape and shape-&#xD;
      distribution. The instrument range, Morphologi, launched in 2007&#xD;
      has since generated sales for&#xD;
      MIL of approximately &amp;#163;11 million since January 2008. The instrument is now&#xD;
      operational within&#xD;
      many industrial sectors and used e.g. to optimise process efficiency and&#xD;
      enhance product quality.&#xD;
      The success of this instrument has contributed to providing secure&#xD;
      employment at MIL and to&#xD;
      obtaining the "Queen's Awards for Enterprise: International Trade" in&#xD;

    Particulate based products are manufactured in many diverse industries&#xD;
      such as, pharmaceutical,&#xD;
      agro-chemical, dyes and pigments, food, detergent and formulation&#xD;
      additives. Particle&#xD;
      morphology, i.e. shape, is vitally important to achieve efficient&#xD;
      manufacturing processes and&#xD;
      produce a final product within its agreed specification. The morphology&#xD;
      can directly affect, e.g., the&#xD;
      flow of a product within a pipe or a hopper, it can affect the dissolution&#xD;
      rate of ingredients within a&#xD;
      chemical reactor and it can affect the final product end-user properties.&#xD;
      In an extreme case,&#xD;
      morphology can change the bio-availability (i.e. uptake within the body)&#xD;
      of pharmaceutical&#xD;
      ingredients, resulting in a company's loss of license to make a drug&#xD;
      product. Given its importance,&#xD;
      it would therefore be beneficial to many companies to have the ability to&#xD;
      actively monitor particle&#xD;
      morphology.&#xD;
    Previous efforts of monitoring particles have focused on optimising and&#xD;
      controlling the particle size&#xD;
      distribution but this clearly misses important information relating to&#xD;
      particle morphology. Moreover,&#xD;
      optimisation and on-line control of shape-distribution during formulation&#xD;
      and manufacture has long&#xD;
      been considered to be too challenging to achieve.&#xD;
    A multi-scale image analysis algorithm based on wavelet analysis [1] was&#xD;
      developed by Professors&#xD;
      XZ Wang and KJ Roberts at the University of Leeds, with PhD&#xD;
      students J Calderon De Anda and&#xD;
      C Ma and research assistant Dr J Chen. The research was conducted with&#xD;
      research council and&#xD;
      industrial support (AstraZeneca, Syngenta, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, 3M&#xD;
      HealthCare and MIL) over&#xD;
      a number of projects such as EPSRC funded projects GR/R43860/01 (PI Roberts,&#xD;
      2002-2006,&#xD;
      &amp;#163;969,560) and EP/C009541/1 (PI Wang, 2005-2009, &amp;#163;315,524) and was&#xD;
      further developed and&#xD;
      transferred to industry with two MIL funded projects. Using crystal edge&#xD;
      detection and&#xD;
      segmentation techniques, the algorithm enabled the fast on-line analysis&#xD;
      of the crystallisation&#xD;
      process where, in contrast to off-line techniques, the crystals were not&#xD;
      necessarily within the&#xD;
      camera depth of focus causing variation of clarity in the image. This&#xD;
      method represents a&#xD;
      milestone for progress in this specific area of research since it allows&#xD;
      process images obtained on-line&#xD;
      to be analysed quantitatively and used for closed-loop control of shape&#xD;
      distribution of a particle&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
    MIL, as an industrial partner to both research projects funded by EPSRC,&#xD;
      were aware of the&#xD;
      technology being developed at the University of Leeds. Collaborating on&#xD;
      MIL's internal research&#xD;
      and development programme `Vision' the research group at Leeds&#xD;
      contributed to their programme&#xD;
      through;&#xD;
    (1) the development of a multi-scale image analysis technique that is the&#xD;
      only method that can&#xD;
      effectively handle images obtained on-line from crystallisation processes&#xD;
      [1];&#xD;
    (2) a 3D imaging probe (StereoVision imaging probe) that is the first&#xD;
      on-line process imaging&#xD;
      probe that can provide real-time particle 3D shape ([2]; new 3-dimension&#xD;
      technology being&#xD;
      patented);&#xD;
    (3) development of a morphological population balance process model which&#xD;
      for the first time&#xD;
      allows modelling and simulation of the dynamic evolution of particle shape&#xD;
      distribution&#xD;
      subject to variation in process operational conditions [3,4,5];&#xD;
    As a result of the above developments, we have achieved closed-loop&#xD;
      control of crystal shape&#xD;
      distribution [6], a task long considered as almost impossible to achieve.&#xD;

    Engagement with the public and with public institutions was both&#xD;
      intrinsic to the research and a&#xD;
      marked form of impact. As `Whose Voices?' matured alongside `Voices of the&#xD;
      UK', a distinguishing&#xD;
      feature of the venture became ongoing feedback between the collaborating&#xD;
      partners of Leeds&#xD;
      University, the BBC and the BL. Upton's research into vernacular language&#xD;
      helped the BBC and&#xD;
      BL to develop strong relationships with communities by way of the language&#xD;
      varieties that&#xD;
      characterise them. For the purposes of this case study, the impacts have&#xD;
      been differentiated into&#xD;
    (i) benefits for public understanding and (ii) benefits for professional&#xD;
      practice, although given the&#xD;
      educational and cultural remits of the key partners, these are necessarily&#xD;
      intertwined.&#xD;
    i. Informing the public understanding of dialect variation&#xD;
    The reach of the projects was significant. Creating participation in BBC&#xD;
      `Voices' and making a&#xD;
      regional vocabulary archive of c.730,000 items available, `Whose Voices?'&#xD;
      encouraged and&#xD;
      informed national debate on regionalism and local identity. Over 84,000&#xD;
      individuals contributed,&#xD;
      with a website (still live: http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/)&#xD;
      enabling the public to input material directly&#xD;
      producing over 8,500 online contributions of data, including 1,201&#xD;
      recorded speakers in 302&#xD;
      interviews. The project was given 10 broadcast hours of TV and 200 hours&#xD;
      of radio time, including&#xD;
      7 x R4 programmes at peak times and a dedicated `Voices Week' across BBC&#xD;
      local and regional&#xD;
      networks. A further 111 newspaper articles reached a 43.7 million&#xD;
      readership [A].&#xD;
    Significant community-focused public benefits were recognised in the&#xD;
      British Academy's booklet,&#xD;
      which was launched in the House of Commons as part of Universities Week&#xD;
      (17 June 2010) [A]. As&#xD;
      one of 10 case studies and the only representative of English studies,&#xD;
      `Whose Voices?' illustrated&#xD;
      how arts research contributed to social empowerment and how `words,&#xD;
      accents and dialects reveal&#xD;
      much about our national and community identities.'&#xD;
    Upton's insights on dialectical variation stimulated public institutions&#xD;
      to reach widely into&#xD;
      communities. No other BBC project `has reached so far, into so many&#xD;
      communities' [C]. An online&#xD;
      Voices map (http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/results/wordmap/)&#xD;
      created engagement throughout the&#xD;
      UK to share information `about communities to communities all over the&#xD;
      UK.' Upton developed an&#xD;
      editorial brief to train local audio recorders to capture what was&#xD;
      significant in everyday language&#xD;
      use. Crucially, the project enriched the cultural life of geographically&#xD;
      isolated UK communities,&#xD;
      such as one village in Scotland which obtained a sense of its place on the&#xD;
      UK map via the&#xD;
      engagement with BBC audio recorders. The process of assembling the&#xD;
      recordings enabled the&#xD;
      BBC to understand the significance of dialectical differences and to&#xD;
      engage directly with often-new&#xD;
      communities creating a horizontal, rather than top-down, relationship. The&#xD;
      broadcasts and website&#xD;
      validated and shared dialectical differences between communities,&#xD;
      for example with `recordings of&#xD;
      Polari the Gay slang, and people... talking about Scouse Jamaican Patois,'&#xD;
      where previously&#xD;
      `outside of the groups that were using those languages, most people didn't&#xD;
      even know those&#xD;
      dialects existed . . . now they've shared them and anyone can hear them&#xD;
      used.' This&#xD;
      dissemination of dialectical differences helped the BBC promote diversity&#xD;
      [all corroborated in C].&#xD;
    BBC's `Voices'-generated materials were deposited in the British Library&#xD;
      Sound Archive and used&#xD;
      in the BL's `Evolving English' public exhibition (November 2010 - April&#xD;
      2011). According to the BL&#xD;
      [D], Upton's codification of that material was `invaluable' in helping to&#xD;
      build the content and&#xD;
      knowledge underpinning the exhibition, enhancing the collection and making&#xD;
      a framework for&#xD;
      accessing it. Upton's study of local detail brought new research insights&#xD;
      that helped the BL make&#xD;
      its collection `more accessible. . . more widely available'. `Evolving&#xD;
      English' proved to be the most&#xD;
      successful winter exhibition ever at the BL, attracting a wider-than-usual&#xD;
      audience profile. The&#xD;
      research was drawn upon to generate both public events and a learning&#xD;
      programme attracting a&#xD;
      big schools audience (many schools came from outside BL's usual&#xD;
      constituencies), with most&#xD;
      events sold out. 150,000 visitors in total attended the exhibition, an&#xD;
      average 1,015 visitors per day,&#xD;
      with the majority of visitors new to BL and a high level of press interest&#xD;
      throughout [D]. The&#xD;
      research enabled the BL to generate interest in and increase public&#xD;
      understanding of their&#xD;
      collections. Against expectations, they found that `there was an untapped&#xD;
      thirst for information,&#xD;
      and a really popular interest' in the collection [all corroborated in D].&#xD;
      The exhibition website, which&#xD;
      remains live, contains podcasts by Upton, Crystal, Barry Cryer, Steven&#xD;
      Pinker and others&#xD;
      (http://www.bl.uk/whatson/podcasts/prevexhibition/english/index.html).&#xD;
    ii. Changing the professional practice of public organisations and&#xD;
        helping them to meet&#xD;
        their organisational objectives&#xD;
    In level and nature, public engagement in `Whose Voices?' helped the BBC&#xD;
      fulfil its published&#xD;
      `public purposes' of `sustaining citizenship and civil society',&#xD;
      `promoting education and learning' and&#xD;
      `representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities.' As the&#xD;
      largest joint partnership with&#xD;
      which the organisation has been involved, `Voices' represented a new way&#xD;
      of working for the BBC,&#xD;
      in sustained collaboration with academics. The project also impacted upon&#xD;
      the BBC's deployment&#xD;
      of web resources for engaging audiences. Informed by the project's&#xD;
      research on media [3, 4], the&#xD;
      BBC gained enhanced appreciation of its website practices. `Voices' was&#xD;
      the first time the internet&#xD;
      was central to a BBC project, `and the way in which it engaged people from&#xD;
      all over the UK&#xD;
      probably has influenced how BBC projects have used the web since.' The&#xD;
      research determined&#xD;
      editorial policy on wider programme development; for example the online&#xD;
      and interactive element&#xD;
      of `History of the World in 100 Objects' was directly inspired by `Voices'&#xD;
      [C].&#xD;
    The research generated materials which helped the BL to meet its&#xD;
      published strategic aim of&#xD;
      guaranteeing access for future generations. The collection and exhibition&#xD;
      contributed to their aim of&#xD;
      `enriching the cultural life of the nation' and have furthered BL goals of&#xD;
      `growing the world's&#xD;
      knowledge base' and `promoting the public understanding of social&#xD;
      science'. `Voices' also inspired&#xD;
      strategic change in the organisation. Whereas previously exhibitions were&#xD;
      typically object- or&#xD;
      collection-led, with `Evolving English' the BL realised the potential of a&#xD;
      thematic-led exhibition&#xD;
      drawing on different parts of the collections. `Without a doubt it enabled&#xD;
      us to explore new themes&#xD;
      and look at presenting collections in a new way.' Having an academic as a&#xD;
      core member of the&#xD;
      Library Advisory Committee was unusual but with Upton's presence the BL&#xD;
      learned that `having&#xD;
      that connection to the research certainly made a real difference to the&#xD;
      success of the project and...&#xD;
      for future working, it reinforces to us how important it is to have that&#xD;
      sort of collaboration with&#xD;
      academics' [D].&#xD;

    This case study describes a unique collaboration between Professor Clive&#xD;
      Upton and researchers&#xD;
      at the University of Leeds, the BBC and the British Library (BL),&#xD;
      examining language variation. As&#xD;
      a result of a programme assembling and researching the largest recorded&#xD;
      archive of dialects and&#xD;
      speech patterns assembled in the UK, two major interlinked forms of impact&#xD;
      were generated:&#xD;
    i. Informing public understanding of dialect and English language use,&#xD;
      thereby validating diverse&#xD;
      regional and national identities.&#xD;
    ii. Contributing to the professional practice and goals of the BBC and&#xD;
      the BL through policy&#xD;
      enhancement, training, and developing broadcast and exhibition content.&#xD;

    Professor Upton (appointed as Lecturer in Language in 1997, since 2012&#xD;
      Emeritus Professor) is a&#xD;
      leading dialectologist whose research has been shaped by, and in turn&#xD;
      advanced, the 65-year&#xD;
      renowned study of English dialect at the University of Leeds. Upton's&#xD;
      expertise lies in regional&#xD;
      English dialectal variation; he has acted as pronunciation consultant for&#xD;
      the Oxford English&#xD;
        Dictionary and with responsibility for the British element of the Oxford&#xD;
        Dictionary of Pronunciation&#xD;
        for Current English. His research has captured and explored social&#xD;
      attitudes towards variation;&#xD;
      elucidated the importance of the means and media by which dialectical&#xD;
      variation is recorded and&#xD;
      analysed; and has significantly expanded the data to evidence the&#xD;
      continuing vitality of local&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;
    Upton began his research as RA, in 1975, to Professor Harold Orton, who&#xD;
      initiated, at the&#xD;
      University, the only systematic series survey of the dialects of England&#xD;
      to be carried out, the&#xD;
      Survey of English Dialects (SED). Upton has been associated with SED&#xD;
      for 40 years. The most&#xD;
      recent publication in the SED series, coordinated and devised by Upton but&#xD;
      supported by a team,&#xD;
      SED The Dictionary and Grammar, made available for the first time&#xD;
      the material gathered by the&#xD;
      historic SED, while adding a systematic analysis of the syntactic&#xD;
      patterns of various dialects [1].&#xD;
      With AHRB funding and acting as PI with support of Co-I Oliver Pickering,&#xD;
      then curator of Special&#xD;
      Collections of the University's Brotherton Library, Upton developed the&#xD;
      `Leeds Archive of&#xD;
      Vernacular Culture' [5], a programme that recovered, digitised, catalogued&#xD;
      and made accessible,&#xD;
      via the Web, the extensive collection of sound recordings (previously&#xD;
      dispersed in the Brotherton&#xD;
      Library and the School of English) amassed by the SED and the Institute of&#xD;
      Dialect and Folk Life&#xD;
      Studies.&#xD;
    Upton's work with the SED gave rise to a second AHRC-funded research&#xD;
      project, `Whose&#xD;
      Voices?' [6], awarded to Professor Sally Johnson (also then at the&#xD;
      University) and Upton,&#xD;
      to develop a partnership, initially research-based, between the University&#xD;
      and the BBC.&#xD;
      The `Whose Voices?' project had a twofold remit: first, the examination of&#xD;
      issues of&#xD;
      linguistic ideology as evidenced by the BBC and discussants on the BBC's&#xD;
      `Voices'&#xD;
      website; and second, the collection and interpretation of hitherto&#xD;
      little-understood matters of&#xD;
      community language use, especially in the seldom-explored area of local&#xD;
      vocabulary. The&#xD;
      BBC `Voices' project produced the largest recorded research archive of&#xD;
      dialects and&#xD;
      speech patterns ever assembled, with greater breadth and depth of coverage&#xD;
      even than&#xD;
      SED work, and has been described by leading language scholar Professor&#xD;
      David Crystal&#xD;
      as `the most significant popular survey of regional English ever&#xD;
      undertaken in Britain' [A].&#xD;
    Since 2008 and the retirement of Johnson, Upton (as PI on the project)&#xD;
      was joined by RA&#xD;
      Dr Milani (replaced by Birch, departed 2010), and two doctoral students,&#xD;
      Turner and&#xD;
      Thompson, whose PhD theses developed the ideological and methodological&#xD;
      matters in&#xD;
      the research. `Whose Voices?' allowed the Leeds team of researchers to&#xD;
      advance the area,&#xD;
      for example in developing a `hypermodal' approach: a methodology requiring&#xD;
      the&#xD;
      researcher to account for visual, as well as phonic, function in language&#xD;
      representation in&#xD;
      the new media [2, 4]. Other research attended to computer-mediated&#xD;
      communication&#xD;
      multilingualism [3] and resulted in a book exploring language ideologies&#xD;
      in modern media&#xD;
      [2].&#xD;
    Through Upton, `Whose Voices?' also worked with a BBC-inspired project at&#xD;
      the BL, `Voices of the&#xD;
      UK', funded by the Leverhulme [7], to develop and deposit recordings in&#xD;
      the Sound Archive.&#xD;
      Research undertaken in both projects cumulatively underlined that, in&#xD;
      spite of standardisation and&#xD;
      speakers' increased exposure to other accents and dialects through&#xD;
      television and radio, regional&#xD;
      and social language variation is thriving. Through the collaborations a&#xD;
      better understanding was&#xD;
      gained of the language varieties of users, engaging and in turn informing&#xD;
      local populations on&#xD;
      matters of significance to their social structures, networks, and&#xD;
      identities. In addition, the research&#xD;
      generated new methodologies for how dialectical variation is captured,&#xD;
      disseminated and analysed.&#xD;

Following phase II trials undertaken&#xD;      by GlaxoWellcome in 2005, this NNRTI has since been licensed to a number&#xD;      of pharmaceutical companies around the world for drug development. Most&#xD;      NNRTIs approved for the clinic from 2000 onwards were optimised based on&#xD;      the Stuart Groups structure-based design. These include etravirine, which&#xD;      was developed by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, and rilpiravine a second&#xD;      generation NNRTI with an improved therapeutic index, both of which are&#xD;      produced by Tibotec Pharmaceuticals 8. Pfizer, the largest&#xD;      pharmaceutical company in the world, replicated the protein constructs and&#xD;      crystallization methods from the University of Oxford's Stuart Group,&#xD;      using similar structural information to conceive new drug targets. As a&#xD;      result Pfizer produced X-ray protein structures of all of their key&#xD;      anti-HIV compounds, several of which (including Lersivirine, formally&#xD;      known as UK-453,061) advanced into clinical trials, but were never&#xD;      licensed for therapy 9. ViiV Healthcare, a specialist HIV&#xD;      pharmaceutical company driven by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, is now&#xD;      developing Lersivirine in Phase III trials. There are currently 2 more&#xD;      NNRTIs in late-stage development; Ardea BioScience's RDEA806 and ViiV's&#xD;      GSK-2248761. In addition, global pharmaceutical companies such as Gilead 10&#xD;      and Merck11 have all used data from the Stuart Group in their&#xD;      NNRTI drug development pipelines. At present there are 5 NNRTIs licensed&#xD;      for clinical use. The anti-HIV drug sales market stood at $11.3billion in&#xD;      2010 and this is projected to rise yearly by 4.6% (The Global Market for&#xD;      AIDS/HIV testing and Treatment &amp;#8212; BCC Research 2011). Globally, there is an&#xD;      increase in the use of HAART, which is reflected in these figures.&#xD;    Patient Health &amp;amp; Quality of Life&#xD;      A recent epidemiological study, evaluating current issues in the&#xD;      management of HIV-infected patients, found that the availability of potent&#xD;      next-generation NNRTIs might offer improved therapy for&#xD;      treatment-experienced patients, particularly those with multi-resistant&#xD;      HIV. The study also showed that new NNRTI drugs may reduce HIV&#xD;      immunological and clinical progression, and as a result, may also reduce&#xD;      treatment costs 12. Median survival time after infection with&#xD;      HIV without treatment is 11 years, contrasting with survival time close to&#xD;      50 years for an HIV-infected individual treated from age 20 (UNAIDS&#xD;      Reference Group for Estimates, Modeling and Projections, 2006). After AIDS&#xD;      diagnosis however, untreated individuals survive to 6-19 months post&#xD;      diagnosis whereas with treatment many individuals recover to a stable&#xD;      latent state of infection with survival rates of ~50 years, approximating&#xD;      other HIV-infected individuals (Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort&#xD;      Collaboration report, Lancet, 372:293-299, 2008). In a study analysing the&#xD;      cost-effectiveness of first line HAART regimens in UK patient groups over&#xD;      the period 1996-2006, it was shown that a regimen of 2NRTIs + NNRTI was&#xD;      the most effective therapy. In comparison to the alternative regimen of&#xD;      2NRTIs + PI (boosted) the study showed that the + NNRTI regimen saved&#xD;      &amp;#163;35,194 per annum in HAART treatments 13. Effective HAART&#xD;      therapy can now be shown to achieve survival rates for people living with&#xD;      HIV equivalent to those in the general population 14,&#xD;      emphasizing the success of new generation ART drug regimens.&#xD;    Policy and Guidelines&#xD;      Clinical guidelines worldwide now recommend NNRTIs in combination with&#xD;      NRTIs as the first line therapy for HIV. The standard HAART combination of&#xD;      two NRTIs with an NNRTI, is recommended by the World Health Organization&#xD;      in their guidelines for antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection in adults&#xD;      and adolescents (last revised in 2010) 15. The British HIV&#xD;      Association guidelines for the treatment of HIV-infected adults with&#xD;      antiretroviral therapy recommend the use of an efavirenz-based regimen as&#xD;      the first line choice for patients with HIV 16. They based&#xD;      this recommendation on data, which has indicated the efficacy, low&#xD;      toxicity and the ease of administration of efavirenz NNRTIs, which were&#xD;      developed based on the Stuart Groups structure-based design.&#xD;    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;    Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) is a combination of drugs&#xD;      used to effectively control HIV infection. Since 1987 Nucleoside Reverse&#xD;      Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) had been used in HAART combinations to&#xD;      specifically target HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, however, resistance and&#xD;      side effects soon prompted the need for an alternative. In 1998,&#xD;      University of Oxford Professors David Stuart and David Stammers provided&#xD;      the first detailed structural framework to facilitate the design of a&#xD;      highly effective alternative class of drug, the Non-Nucleoside Reverse&#xD;      Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs). NNRTIs have since been developed for&#xD;      clinical use, impacting the pharmaceutical industry and profoundly&#xD;      improving the quality of life of patients.&#xD;    </ImpactSummary><ImpactType>Technological</ImpactType><Institution>&#xD;    The University of Oxford&#xD;    </Institution><Institutions><HEI><AlternativeName>Oxford (University of)</AlternativeName><InstitutionName>University of Oxford</InstitutionName><PeerGroup>65</PeerGroup><Region>South East</Region><UKPRN>10007774</UKPRN></HEI></Institutions><Panel>A         </Panel><PlaceName/><References>&#xD;

This&#xD;      is achieved by the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme, which is encoded by&#xD;      the HIV genome. The resulting DNA serves as a template for the creation of&#xD;      more HIV RNA genomes, which can then be assembled into new viral&#xD;      offspring. Reverse transcription is particularly vulnerable to errors.&#xD;      Over many generations of viral replication, this leads to high genetic&#xD;      diversity, which can in turn lead to drug resistance.&#xD;    Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) were the first&#xD;      antiretroviral drugs developed to control AIDS, but because NRTIs were&#xD;      used as monotherapy, HIV soon developed resistance to the drug. Plagued by&#xD;      resistance and a number of unpleasant side effects, including fat&#xD;      deposition and nausea, the need for an alternative therapy quickly became&#xD;      a priority for HIV researchers. Discovered serendipitously in 1989,&#xD;      Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) were extremely&#xD;      susceptible to resistance via single amino acid changes in HIV-1 RT. The&#xD;      mechanism of NNRTI action and the nature of its interactions with the&#xD;      target, however, remained unknown. After the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT&#xD;      was published in 1992 1, work by the University of Oxford's&#xD;      David Stuart refined this model by producing a series of papers in 1995&#xD;      describing the first high-resolution structures of NNRTIs and HIV-RT and&#xD;      other data, which became the basis for structure-based drug design 2-5.&#xD;      The structure of RT-NNRTI complexes identified structural features, which&#xD;      correlated with potency, providing an explanation for the mode of action&#xD;      of these compounds 3.&#xD;    In 1996 Professor David Stammers joined Professor Stuart and his team at&#xD;      the University of Oxford. Professor Stammers' spin off company, Arrow&#xD;      Therapeutics, assisted the group in delving further into the development&#xD;      of NNRTI drug therapy. They then shared this information with&#xD;      GlaxoWellcome Pharmaceuticals (now GlaxoSmithKline). The Oxford group&#xD;      provided a database of atomic information to GlaxoWellcome, prior to the&#xD;      intellectual property becoming public domain, enabling the early&#xD;      development of NNRTI drug therapy. This atomic information still comprises&#xD;      over 50% of the available data on NNRTIs, while collaborative studies&#xD;      involving the University of Oxford's structural biologists have also&#xD;      provided detailed explanations for the mechanisms leading to drug&#xD;      resistance 4,5. Continuing this collaboration with industry,&#xD;      specific chemical series were devised which were outstandingly refractory&#xD;      to the development of resistance 6, one of which (GW695634)&#xD;      entered phase II clinical trials in 2005. The GW695634 chemical series&#xD;      generated the prodrug (a compound modified for active use in the body) of&#xD;      GW678248, an NNRTI with potent antiviral activity against efavirenz- and&#xD;      nevirapine-resistant HIV-1 viruses. This has led to the development of a&#xD;      second-generation of NNRTIs for use in HAART drug combinations.&#xD;    </UnderpinningResearch></CaseStudyDump><CaseStudyDump><CaseStudyId>10807</CaseStudyId><Continent><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>6255148</GeoNamesId><Name>Europe</Name></GeoLocation></Continent><Country><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>2635167</GeoNamesId><Name>United Kingdom</Name></GeoLocation></Country><Funders xmlns:a="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><a:string>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</a:string><a:string>Royal Society</a:string></Funders><ImpactDetails>
    The research carried out at Portsmouth has impacted on the development
      and validation of a new generation of nickel-based superalloys via a power
      metallurgy route, including U720Li and RR1000, which have since been used
      in Rolls-Royce engines including Trent 500, 900, 1000; BR 700, 710 and
      725. The new materials have allowed engines to operate at higher
      temperatures compared with those using traditional wrought alloys, with
      significant reduction of CO2 emission as well as much improved
      structural integrity of fracture-critical turbine discs.
    High-pressure turbine discs in gas turbines are one of the key components
      that dictate the overall efficiency of an engine. To achieve reduced CO2
      emmission, a higher overall engine efficiency is required by operating the
      engine with a hotter, more thermodynamically efficient cycle. This
      requires the use of new materials with better capabilities to resist
      creep, fatigue and oxidation at higher operational temperatures. New
      material development requires fundamental research so that their
      mechanical performance is fully evaluated under simulated service
      conditions. The MBM lab at Portsmouth is one of the RR-approved centres
      for new material research and validation work, due to our unique
      specialist testing facilities developed in-house, which allow
      well-controlled testing conditions and much-reduced test durations and
      increased data generation per test piece, which otherwise not possible
      with conventional methods. For research on fine grain RR1000 and U720Li,
      work at Portsmouth has provided the first set of systematic
      results on the effects of load ratio and loading waveform on crack growth
      rates [1] and, identified, for the first time, the failure
      mechanisms in time-independent/dependent regimes [1, 2]. These, together
      with the concerted efforts of alloy development (Cambridge University) and
      microstructure characterisation (University of Southampton), have given
      confidence to RR in adopting the new materials in their disc
        production. For coarse grain RR1000 investigated in the DISPLACE
      programme, we extended our detailed constitutive model [3] to cover the entire
        range of operational and limit temperatures and developed a fatigue-creep-oxidation
        model [6; Karabela1] which enabled the
      prediction of crack growth rate considering the coupling effects of all
      three factors for the first time. Together with the University of
      Birmingham on the optimisation of material variables to minimise crack
      growth; Serco on testing under combined thermo-mechanical testing and
      ZenCrack on developing commercial finite element software for life
      prediction of crack growth under simulated flight cycles, we successfully
      delivered the project, with a direct impact on the RR in-house lifing
        and materials development programme towards the certification of the
        material, which paved the way for its use in the latest RR engines.
    RR has confirmed that the new material and lifing technology developed
      will be used for Trent XWB-1000 engines; and also in new engine projects
      and up-rated versions of the Trent 900 and 1000 for Airbus A380 and Boeing
      787. It has also a retrofit capability into the current high by-pass
      turbofan engine fleet, thus increasing the potential impact further. These
      represent a &amp;#163;1.2 billion per year market opportunity to the UK
      aerospace industry. A 1% specific fuel consumption (sfc) saving in these
      products equates to 350kg less fuel used per engine per trans-Atlantic
      flight. This reduces the cost of ownership by approximately &amp;#163;100,000
        per engine per year. The indirect benefits of this include reduced
        travel costs due to reduced fuel consumption; increased economic
        competitiveness of UK airlines in the world market and expansion of
      employment opportunities in associated UK industries. There are direct
        economic benefits to end-users in reduced operating costs, which for
      the above example are estimated to be &amp;#163;200,000 per year. The use
      of the technology will also provide a sustainability benefit
      through the extended use of components.
    It is anticipated that the temperature capability of the engines will be
      improved by approximately 30&amp;#186;C as a result of the new material solution
      from DISPLACE. This equates to a reduction in sfc, which for the designs
      considered is estimated at 0.3% improvement. For a large twin-engined
      aircraft flying from London to New York, a 0.3% sfc saving equates to a
      700 kg reduction in fuel consumption, which translates into a reduction
        of ~ 2.25 tonnes of CO2 emissions per flight.
      RR engines introduced in 2012 onwards offer improved emissions and engine
      efficiency over current designs as a result of this new material solution,
      thus a significant step towards the ACARE industry goals for 2050 of a 50%
      reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometre.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research at Portsmouth has significantly improved the understanding of
      damage tolerance under creep-fatigue-oxidation conditions experienced in
      aero-engine components. The understanding has been developed through
      research on a new-generation disc materials including U720Li and RR1000,
      which have since been used in Rolls-Royce engines including Trent 900 in
      Airbus A380, Trent 1000 in Boeing 787 and the latest Trent for Airbus A350
      XWB. These new materials have enabled aircraft to operate more efficiently
      at higher temperatures, with a major impact on CO2
        emission and a significant impact on economy due to the new
      market opportunities and the reduction of operating costs.

    High-pressure turbine discs in gas turbines are made of nickel-based
      superalloys. A turbine disc is a fracture critical component where the
      failure of the disc can lead to the loss of the aircraft. It is also one
      of the key components that dictates the overall efficiency of an engine
      cycle. The structural integrity of discs under operational loading
      conditions, including fatigue, creep and oxidation, is of paramount
      importance to safety as well as to engine efficiency. The Mechanical
      Behaviour of Materials (MBM) group at UoP has been working on fatigue
      crack growth behaviour in nickel-based superalloys for many years, in
      collaboration with Rolls-Royce (RR) and the Ministry of Defence (now
      QinetiQ and Dstl). Since 1996, the group (Tong, Lupton,
      Byrne) has been engaged in collaborative research with RR and other
      university partners on the development and validation of a new generation
      of nickel-based superalloys via a powder metallurgy route, including
      U720Li and RR1000 [1-4]. The role of the Portsmouth group has been
      distinctive from those of the other university partners in that we have
      specifically focused on: (i) Novel specialist testing using fracture
      mechanics concepts that allows well-controlled testing conditions with
      significantly reduced test durations, which otherwise would not be
      possible using conventional testing methods; and (ii) constitutive
      modelling of creep-fatigue and creep-fatigue-oxidation that enables more
      accurate predictions of crack growth rates at elevated temperature. In
      particular, we systematically examined the effects of loading waveform and
      R ratio on crack growth of alloy U720Li [1]; fatigue-creep interaction
      [2-4]; constitutive modelling under creep-fatigue [3] and proposed a new
      crack growth criterion [5, Tong1]. Through these
      we have developed an essential framework on which crack growth in
      nickel-based superalloys may be characterised.
    This long-standing successful collaborative work led to the invitation of
      Portsmouth group to a joint bid to TSB, which was subsequently awarded and
      launched in 2008 as DISPLACE. The Portsmouth work was mainly on the
      understanding of the effects of in-service loading variables on crack
      growth rate and predicting crack growth lives for complex engine cycles,
      utilising both novel experimental testing and advanced numerical
      modelling. Specifically, we further developed our capacities in
      constitutive modelling to cover the extended operational temperature
      range, and utilised the vacuum data from partners to validate our new
      crack growth criterion [5; Tong1] for the very
      first time. We were also able to develop our work into
      creep-fatigue-oxidation using a crystal-plasticity theory [6; Lin1;
      Karabela1], a new area of research funded by the
      EPSRC and the TSB. New collaborations have been developed as a result of
      our crack tip work [5, Tong1, 3], both in the UK
      (Universities of Manchester and Sheffield; Rolls-Royce) and abroad (Ecole
      Polytechnique, France; Huazhong University of Science and Technology,
      China). These collaborations have also provided a fundamental framework
      for a recent collaborative research project on oxidation damage and its
      significance in crack growth, funded by the EPSRC (Zhao &amp;amp; Tong,
      EP/K026844/1, 2013).

    Context: Dental decay is the most common of all diseases
      (prevalence is 1/10 of the population of
      the western world, i.e. 100 million lesions per year) yet the principles
      of treatment for dental decay
      have remained unchanged for almost 100 years. The earliest sign of tooth
      decay is the "white
      spot" lesion, visible to the clinician on the tooth surface. There is no
      current consensus view as to
      how this should be treated. Clinicians have three choices: 1) monitor the
      lesion to determine
      whether or not it is advancing (ie getting bigger), then excavate and
      fill; 2) apply fluoride
      treatments, then proceed as in (1) or 3) place a small restoration. Ultimately,
        all restorations will
        fail needing to be replaced by larger fillings. Treatment currently
      costs the UK &amp;#163;2 billion each year
      within the NHS alone (Office of the Govt Auditor), driving oral health
      inequalities. Drilling is feared
      by many patients, inhibiting their attendance at the dentist and so
      precluding opportunities for early
      diagnosis and treatment of decay as well as diseases such as oral cancer.
      Leeds' self-assembling
      peptide technology provides a simple and cost effective alternative to
      current treatments (costs
      approx. 50% of the most simple conventional filling), allowing the
      clinician to heal rather than repair
      dental decay. This removes the clinician's dilemma of "to treat or not to
      treat" and takes away the
      need for drilling and therefore the fear of visiting the dentist.
    New IP generated
      The platform technology for self-assembly design at Leeds was first
      patented in 1999 [B]. This
      underpins a number of diverse applications, including the design of
      biomimetic scaffolds in tissue
      engineering. Following Leeds research using self-assembling peptide
      technology to treat artificially
      created decay lesions in extracted human teeth, an applications patent was
      filed in 2002 in Europe
      and the US [B]. Later Leeds research comparing different peptide designs
      in respect of their ability
      to nucleate mineral crystals and to regenerate bone led to the filing of a
      Divisional patent in the US
      [B].
    Impacts on commerce:
    A spin-out company ("Credentis AG", Switzerland), in which
      the University of Leeds is major
      stakeholder, was created in 2010 [C] when the license to exploit Leeds' IP
      on self-assembling
      peptides in the dental domain was granted to the company [D]. The company
      has now completed
      two successful investment rounds with a value of 4.5 million ChF [D] and
      has created a new
      business opportunity for a UK company, Optident, who will distribute and
      supply the products
      within the UK market from September 2013 [E]. Credentis is recognised as
      one of the top Swiss
      spin outs [A]. The company won the prestigious Swiss Technology Award in
      November 2013. In
      2012, Credentis opened a UK office in Leeds, reflecting the continuing
      close collaboration with
      researchers at the University. This includes a new &amp;#163;1.02 million
      collaborative award via the Leeds
      EPSRC Medical Technologies Innovation Knowledge Centre to develop second
      generation
      peptides for further dental applications, increasing the Credentis product
      range. Leeds
      researchers (Kirkham, Aggeli) are developing new technology and
      minimising commercial risk via
      provision of access to a full and validated pipeline screening facility,
      including (i) rational peptide
      design, including self-assembling conditions, (ii) in silico
      modelling, (iii) rheological testing, (iv)
      screening for capacity to induce mineralisation de novo, (v) cytotoxicity
      testing (vi) in situ (ex-vivo)
      testing, (vii) clinical trials and (viii) stability testing, packaging and
      process development.
    Two new products: Curodont RepairTM and later
      Curodont ProtectTM based on the same P11-4
      Curalox&amp;#174;technology containing peptide P11-4, developed and
      patented by Leeds researchers,
      have now entered the market in Switzerland and Germany [D]. Curalox&amp;#174;
      was granted a CE label in
      2012 [D] for clinical use as a class IIa medical device and has obtained
      approval for use in
      Canada. Large scale production of the first product, Curodont RepairTM
        provides a fully GMP-
      compliant product (100,000 patient treatments in the first run) [D]. Leeds
      researchers contributed
      towards this by conducting first in man safety trials for P11-4 [6],
      demonstrating a clear clinical
      improvement after treatment of class 5 lesions with the peptide. In
      addition, patient acceptability
      was shown to be very high.
    Overseas industry has invested in research and development
      for these peptides (including
      P11-4) via a collaborative research project supported by Geistlich
      Biomaterials (Switzerland; &amp;#163;55K)
      [F] as well as support from Credentis AG. The former sought to test the
      hypothesis that self-
      assembling peptides would promote bone regeneration. Geistlich focus on
      biomaterials for
      maxillo-facial bone repair and the Leeds peptides have proved to be highly
      efficient for bone
      regeneration in an animal model [F]. Further funding to use P11-4 in
      combination with Bio-Oss in
      sinus lift procedures (to improve healing times and outcomes for maxillary
      dental implants) has
      been secured via the EPSRC Medical Technologies IKC (&amp;#163;190K) to fund
      proof-of-concept in an
      animal model.
    Impact on health and welfare: A new clinical
        intervention (a medical device for restoration of
      early enamel caries and a preventive treatment for acid erosion) has been
      developed, trialled with
      patients and a definite positive outcome demonstrated [6]. Leeds
      researchers were involved in all
      stages of product design and testing from bench to chairside. The product
      is seen by the
      profession to fill the previously unfilled gap between prevention and
      surgical intervention ("Filling")
      [G].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Multi-disciplinary research at Leeds has led to a step change for
      treatment of early tooth decay
      using a minimally invasive regenerative therapy, eliminating the need for
      surgical excavation
      ("Filling without Drilling"). The patented technology was licensed to a
      spin-out company (Credentis
      ag), completed "first in man" trials at Leeds [6] and received a CE-label
      for clinical use in
      Switzerland, Europe and Canada. The trials demonstrated clinical efficacy
      that is safe and
      favoured by patients. Two new products are now on the market. Credentis
      were recognised as
      one of the top start ups in Switzerland [A], won the Swiss Technology
      Award in 2013, have
      established a new UK base and have engaged a UK company as suppliers,
      creating new business
      for a UK owned industry.

    Case study 2. "Filling without Drilling": Use of Self Assembling Peptides

      Biomimetic Scaffolds in Treatment of Early Enamel Decay (Caries) Lesions
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    The new regenerative therapy for treatment of early enamel decay (caries)
      developed out of multi-
      disciplinary basic and applied research via a Leeds collaboration led by Amalia
        Aggeli
      (Department of Chemistry, formerly Royal Society University Research
      Fellow at Leeds, now
      Lecturer) and Jennifer Kirkham (Professor of Oral Biology, School
      of Dentistry).
    In 1997, supported by the EPSRC and the Wellcome Trust, Aggeli
      and colleagues in the Faculty
      of Biological Sciences described the driving principles governing the
      spontaneous self-assembly of
      03b2-sheet forming peptides into fibrillar scaffold structures, including
      the ability to design in
      responsiveness to specific external triggers in order to control the
      assembly process [1,2]. Under
      specific conditions, these peptides undergo one dimensional self-assembly,
      forming micrometer-
      long, 03b2-sheet "nanotapes". Nanotapes then stack in pairs to form
      ribbons which in turn further
      assemble to form fibrils and pairs of fibrils entwine edge-to-edge to form
      fibres. This assembly
      process is principally driven by intermolecular H bonding arising from the
      peptide backbone
      together with additional interactions between specific side chains and
      offered a new generation of
      biomaterials with potential uses across a range of applications.
    Kirkham's group (funded through Kirkham's Wellcome Trust programme
      and associated
      Wellcome Trust and BBSRC project grants from 1998 onwards) utilised enamel
      development as a
      paradigm for understanding the way in which extracellular matrix proteins
      control crystal
      nucleation, deposition and tissue architecture in mammalian
      biomineralisation. Via a programme
      of gene discovery coupled with rodent models and structure-function
      studies, the principles
      underpinning the control of crystal growth in developing enamel were
      described, leading to the
      hypothesis that domains of negative charge on extracellular matrix
      proteins (themselves self-
      assembling) were responsible for crystal nucleation during enamel
      biomineralisation [3-4].
    Kirkham and Aggeli's collaboration used knowledge gained from an
      understanding of the way in
      which mineralised tissues form, combined with an understanding of the
      drivers behind peptide self-
      assembly to address clinical challenges in mineralised tissue repair and
      regeneration. Peptides
      were selected that would be unassembled (monomeric) at pH values &amp;gt;7.5,
      providing a low
      viscosity, injectable fluid that would spontaneously assemble to form a 3D
      fibrillar scaffold under
      physiological conditions. In addition, peptides were designed to provide,
      via their amino acid side
      chains, domains of negative charge once assembled. The resulting 3D
      structures, therefore,
      mirror biological macromolecules found in extracellular matrices of the
      mammalian skeleton.
    Applied, collaborative research between the two groups (funded by an
      EPSRC CASE award, a
      Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust research award, the Leeds Wellcome-EPSRC
      Centre of
      Excellence in Medical Engineering and Geistlich Biomaterials, Switzerland)
      went on to test the
      hypotheses that rationally designed self-assembling synthetic peptides
      could nucleate mineral
      crystals in vitro and in situ within artificial decay
      lesions in human teeth [5]. Taking this information
      together, a first-in-man clinical trial was completed in 2012 (led by Paul
        Brunton, Professor of
      Restorative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Leeds) applying one of the
      peptides (P11-4) to early
      enamel decay lesions in patients. The results provided unequivocal
      evidence of safety and efficacy
      following a single treatment of the lesions with the peptide material [6].

    Research at Durham aimed at developing an open-flow cryostat capable of&#xD;
      cooling below liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen temperatures [1] was performed as part of an EPSRC-funded project&#xD;
      in collaboration with&#xD;
      Oxford Cryosystems (OC). OC is an Oxfordshire based company which employs&#xD;
      20 staff and has&#xD;
      an annual turnover of &amp;#163;3-&amp;#163;3.5M. The prototype was completed in 1998 and&#xD;
      the commercial&#xD;
      version was launched by OC as the HeliX at the IUCr Congress in Glasgow,&#xD;
      1999. IP for the Helix&#xD;
      is owned by OC who have sold around 20 units in the 2008-2013 period to&#xD;
      academic institutions&#xD;
      and central facilities globally [Im1].&#xD;

        commercialised by Oxford Cryosystems [2,3]; Olex2 and&#xD;
        Topas Academic crystallography software (right).&#xD;
     &#xD;
    The successful development of the HeliX suggested similar technology&#xD;
      could provide a 12-310 K&#xD;
      cryostat for powder diffraction experiments, filling a market gap for&#xD;
      apparatus that was (a) easy to&#xD;
      use and low maintenance, (b) compatible with a range of diffractometer&#xD;
      configurations and (c)&#xD;
      usable by those without cryogen expertise and did not require expensive&#xD;
      liquid He. A prototype&#xD;
      pHeniX powder cryostat [4] was co-developed with OC, installed in Durham&#xD;
      in 2002, and the&#xD;
      commercial version launched later that year. pHeniX units have been sold&#xD;
      to industry in South&#xD;
      Korea, China, United States, mainland Europe and the UK as well as to&#xD;
      national facilities and&#xD;
      academic institutions directly by OC and through the X-ray manufacturers&#xD;
      PANalytical and Bruker&#xD;
      AXS. Approximately eight units are sold annually. The Director of Sales&#xD;
      and Marketing at Oxford&#xD;
      Cryosystems, said: "it is fair to say that without the research excellence&#xD;
      of Durham University, we&#xD;
      would not be manufacturing and selling these cooling devices as we are&#xD;
      today. OC's product range&#xD;
      has expanded greatly over the past ten years and being able to offer these&#xD;
      products is very&#xD;
      important in allowing us to move into new applications." [Im1]&#xD;

      modern, powerful and easy to use package for the solution, analysis and&#xD;
      refinement of single&#xD;
      crystal X-ray data. The open source version is available free of charge&#xD;
      from the internet and has&#xD;
      been downloaded extensively, providing an estimation that there are over&#xD;
      5000 users worldwide.&#xD;
      The original paper has been cited &amp;gt; 650 times, demonstrating impact on&#xD;
      the global academic&#xD;
      community and in training students, future academics and industrial&#xD;
      scientists. Future development&#xD;
      of Olex2 has been secured through the Durham spinout company OlexSys&#xD;
      [Im2]. OlexSys was&#xD;
      established in December 2010 (Company No 07465154) with the legal&#xD;
      assistance of Durham&#xD;
      University Business and Innovation Services. It has been trading since&#xD;
      June 2011 has a growing&#xD;
      turnover, employs full and part time staff and is chaired by JAKH. OlexSys&#xD;
      has two complementary&#xD;
      and parallel work strands. To keep Olex2 at the scientific cutting-edge&#xD;
      they maintain and develop&#xD;
      the open source version for and on behalf of the global academic&#xD;
      community. They also provide&#xD;
      bespoke software solutions for industry and have commercial contracts with&#xD;
      instrument&#xD;
      manufacturers Agilent, Rigaku and the Cambridge Crystallographic Data&#xD;
      Centre.&#xD;
    One commercial contract is with Agilent [Im3], who install Olex2 with all&#xD;
      of their X-ray systems&#xD;
      (each typically costing &amp;gt; ~&amp;#163;300K). Agilent commissioned OlexSys to&#xD;
      create the exclusive bespoke&#xD;
      commercial product AutoChem. Autochem provides automated, intelligent,&#xD;
      real-time structure&#xD;
      solution and refinement during data collection. Although Agilent company&#xD;
      policy states that specific&#xD;
      sales figures can't be released, the University believes a significant&#xD;
      number of licences have been&#xD;
      sold to date. A major update, Autochem2.0 was commissioned in 2011. It is&#xD;
      derived from Durham&#xD;
      research and OlexSys developments, and described on the Agilent website&#xD;
      as: "The ultimate&#xD;
      productivity tool for chemical crystallography, AutoChem &amp;#8212; now as&#xD;
      AutoChem2.0 &amp;#8212; provides fast,&#xD;
      fully automated structure solution and refinement during data collection.&#xD;
      Developed exclusively for&#xD;
      Agilent by the authors of Olex2, AutoChem2.0 is a seamlessly integrated,&#xD;
      optional plug-in for&#xD;
      CrysAlisPro, offering an advanced approach for automatic structure&#xD;
      determination, and now with&#xD;
      an even higher rate of success."&#xD;
    JSOE has been heavily involved in the development of Topas &amp;#8212; the leading&#xD;
      software for analysis of&#xD;
      powder diffraction data and Rietveld refinement (e.g. [6]). He has worked&#xD;
      closely with Alan Coelho&#xD;
      and Bruker in implementing new ideas and methodologies in this software&#xD;
      [Im4,5]. In particular his&#xD;
      methods for analysing variable temperature/time/chemical environment data&#xD;
      are used worldwide&#xD;
      and the time-of-flight neutron and distortion mode/magnetism methods he&#xD;
      introduced underpin&#xD;
      numerous experiments at UK central facilities (e.g. [7]). The jEdit&#xD;
      interface he developed and&#xD;
      distributes for "power-use" of the software is used by many academic and&#xD;
      industrial groups, and&#xD;
      Durham has trained in excess of 500 people in its use at predominantly&#xD;
      industrial workshops&#xD;
      worldwide (USA, Germany, Italy, UK, Australia). Many of these innovations&#xD;
      are now incorporated&#xD;
      in the commercial version of Topas [Im4], which has a list price around&#xD;
      &amp;#163;10K. Sales figures for&#xD;
      Topas are commercially sensitive information that Bruker cannot release.&#xD;
      Many licenses have&#xD;
      been sold and that their distribution would be approximately 50:50 between&#xD;
      industry and academia.&#xD;
      Many copies of the academic version have been sold to groups worldwide&#xD;
      (80% in REF period)&#xD;
      [Im5]. The Topas community wiki site and discussion forum is run through&#xD;
      Durham&#xD;
      (topas.dur.ac.uk/dokuwiki.php) and has a vibrant and expanding community&#xD;
      with about 300&#xD;
      members. This includes industrial members from industries in the chemicals&#xD;
      (e.g. Johson Mathey,&#xD;
      BASF), cement, pharmaceutical and mining sectors.&#xD;
    Our structural expertise also has significant and direct impact on&#xD;
      industry via the&#xD;
      service/consultancy work we perform under the auspices of the departmental&#xD;
      services. Within the&#xD;
      REF period the Department has performed many single crystal, powder&#xD;
      diffraction and related&#xD;
      analyses. We have also supported industrial users with structure-related&#xD;
      problems via Durham's&#xD;
      industry-funded solid state NMR service, helping 49 companies with work&#xD;
      between January 2008&#xD;
      and July 2013.&#xD;
    The impact of all our crystallographic research is enhanced by regular&#xD;
      international training schools&#xD;
      run in Durham [Im6], e.g. the Powder Diffraction and Rietveld refinement&#xD;
      School (biennial since&#xD;
      2004) and BCA X-Ray Single Crystal Structure Analysis Intensive Training&#xD;
      School (biennial in&#xD;
      Durham since 1995), targeting both academics and industry on an&#xD;
      international scale. Since 2008&#xD;
      the X-ray Single crystal school has trained over 250 participants over 3&#xD;
      schools held biennially and&#xD;
      the powder school has trained &amp;gt;200 delegates from around the world. An&#xD;
      overseas PhD student at&#xD;
      the 2008 powder school stated "I think it was one of the best teaching&#xD;
      courses I have ever&#xD;
      attended" and a UK academic "I would have no hesitation in recommending it&#xD;
      to any academics or&#xD;
      students....there is a huge need for this in the UK"; the International&#xD;
      Union of Crystallography&#xD;
      powder commission described it as a "school others should aspire to". The&#xD;
      problem-based&#xD;
      learning example set for the powder school features many examples derived&#xD;
      from Durham&#xD;
      research ( http://www.dur.ac.uk/john.evans/topas_workshop/pcg_workshop_menu.htm&#xD;
      ) to help&#xD;
      train others in our methods.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Durham Chemistry has a long history of research in cutting edge&#xD;
      crystallographic methods and&#xD;
      innovative instrument design which has led to the commercialisation of&#xD;
      scientific apparatus and&#xD;
      software with significant sales value. Durham-developed apparatus and&#xD;
      crystallographic software&#xD;
      are used globally by both industry and academia. Autochem2, for example,&#xD;
      is sold exclusively to&#xD;
      Agilent via the spin-out company OlexSys, and hundreds of researchers rely&#xD;
      on Durham's&#xD;
      contributions to the Topas software pacakge. Crystallographic research for&#xD;
      pharmaceutical and&#xD;
      other companies, research-based consultancy, commercial analytical&#xD;
      services and provision of&#xD;
      international PhD+ level training schools have led to further significant&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;

    Research in the development of crystallographic methods at Durham has&#xD;
      been carried out by the&#xD;
      groups of Professor Judith A K Howard (JAKH, 1991-), Dr. Andres Goeta&#xD;
      (AEG, 1998-2011dc),&#xD;
      Professor John S.O. Evans (JSOE, 1998-) and Dr Ivana Evans (IRE, 1999-).&#xD;
      Their work forms&#xD;
      part of our Research Grouping in Materials Synthesis and Structure (MSS),&#xD;
      and is supported and&#xD;
      exploited by others working in structural science and, in particular,&#xD;
      solid state NMR.&#xD;
    Durham Chemistry has a strong focus on the synthesis and understanding of&#xD;
      functional materials.&#xD;
      Examples include superconductors, molecular magnets, materials with&#xD;
      electronic and magnetic&#xD;
      phase transitions, gas storage materials, structural materials and&#xD;
      molecular switches. In order to&#xD;
      understand, develop and exploit structure-property relationships in these&#xD;
      materials, high resolution&#xD;
      X-ray-derived structural information is required across a wide temperature&#xD;
      range. Low&#xD;
      temperatures also provide higher quality structural information than&#xD;
      ambient studies and allow&#xD;
      study of otherwise unstable systems. JAKH therefore designed, constructed&#xD;
      and developed the&#xD;
      unique Fddd diffractometer [1] integrating closed cycle cryo-refrigeration&#xD;
      and a high intensity X-ray&#xD;
      beam to enable crystallographic studies of very small crystals down to 9&#xD;
      K. Single crystal X-ray&#xD;
      diffraction studies in the UK had been restricted previously to&#xD;
      temperatures above 100K using&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen temperatures as coolant. The unique facilities developed&#xD;
      in Durham enabled low&#xD;
      temperature studies on a number of important systems with exploitable&#xD;
      macroscopic properties,&#xD;
      but, using a point detector, experiments were slow and only a limited&#xD;
      number of temperatures&#xD;
      could be studied.&#xD;
    The advent of CCD detectors for laboratory diffractometers provided a&#xD;
      solution to the speed&#xD;
      problem, but the data quality obtainable at sub 100 K temperatures was&#xD;
      severely limited by the&#xD;
      complex cryostat environment, with heat shields and windows severely&#xD;
      attenuating the beam and&#xD;
      giving rise to their own strong X-ray scatter. JAKH therefore initiated&#xD;
      research into the development&#xD;
      of an open-flow cooling device, similar to the now ubiquitous liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen devices, but capable of&#xD;
      reaching much lower temperatures [F1]. The cryostat developed, the HeliX,&#xD;
      allowed the first rapid&#xD;
      full structural investigations of novel systems maintained at sub 100 K&#xD;
      temperatures in an open&#xD;
      environment, allowing rapid data acquisition. The design also enabled&#xD;
      laser excitation of samples&#xD;
      allowing full structural investigations of thermally trapped, optically&#xD;
      induced, excited spin state&#xD;
      complexes [2,3].&#xD;
    Many of the new materials prepared and studied in Durham are in&#xD;
      polycrystalline (powdered) form,&#xD;
      but there is still a need to study their low temperature structural&#xD;
      properties. Examples of materials&#xD;
      include those showing negative thermal expansion behaviour [F2],&#xD;
      electronic phase transitions or&#xD;
      light-induced changes. The need to study these materials [3,4] led to [F3]&#xD;
      research by JSOE/AEG&#xD;
      to develop and exploit the pHeniX cryostat for powder diffraction. The&#xD;
      design incorporated novel&#xD;
      features to allow operation on a range of lab-based instruments with a&#xD;
      variety of different sample&#xD;
      types.&#xD;
    The experimental structural and materials science undertaken at Durham&#xD;
      has required parallel&#xD;
      development of computational methods and software tools. In the area of&#xD;
      single crystal diffraction&#xD;
      the JAKH group has an extensive research programme in the development of&#xD;
      computational tools&#xD;
      for data analysis. With EPSRC funding they designed and delivered an&#xD;
      innovative, future-proof,&#xD;
      toolbox based software suite (Olex2) based on Python-integration of a&#xD;
      series of small modules [F4]&#xD;
      using fit-for-purpose programming codes, informed by X-ray crystallography&#xD;
      expertise. This&#xD;
      approach allows the efficient use of established routines and the parallel&#xD;
      development of new&#xD;
      algorithms [5]. In the area of powder diffraction, JSOE has been involved&#xD;
      in the development of the&#xD;
      Topas suite of software and its application for novel data analysis since&#xD;
      the late 1990s. He has&#xD;
      developed data analysis methods for parametric fitting of huge bodies of&#xD;
      diffraction data, for&#xD;
      analysing neutron and energy dispersive diffraction data, and&#xD;
      distortion-mode modelling of&#xD;
      functional materials; these are used by industry and academics [6,7].&#xD;

    In 1992 BNFL established a spin-out company, BNFL Fluorochemicals Ltd,&#xD;
      later F2 Chemicals Ltd,&#xD;
      to develop new markets in the fine chemicals sector using their expertise&#xD;
      in the production and&#xD;
      handling of F2 developed from nuclear power generation&#xD;
      applications. A research team (3 PDRA&#xD;
      employees, 3 years) from the company was seconded to the Chemistry&#xD;
      Department at Durham&#xD;
      (1992-1995) in order to establish a skill base, expertise and IPR in the&#xD;
      field. The company also&#xD;
      provided funds for building and equipping a new, purpose-built research&#xD;
      laboratory for handling F2&#xD;
      within the Chemistry Department and RDC subsequently became a&#xD;
      non-executive Director of the&#xD;
      company. The following period (1993-1996) resulted in a suite of over 20&#xD;
      patent applications which&#xD;
      were filed, granted and maintained by F2 Chemicals arising from the Durham&#xD;
      research&#xD;
      collaboration. Most importantly, development of new selective fluorination&#xD;
      methodology of &amp;#946;-ketoesters&#xD;
      in high dielectric constant media was investigated and exemplified at&#xD;
      Durham on a 1 g&#xD;
      scale and published by the DU research team in collaboration with F2&#xD;
      Chemicals in 1996 [2]&#xD;
      following IPR protection [Im1]. Subsequently, Durham direct fluorination&#xD;
      reaction methodology&#xD;
      using F2 [2] was adopted and scaled up to a manufacturing&#xD;
      process by F2 Chemicals Ltd [Im2] with&#xD;
      the design, investment and construction of a 1000 litre Selective Direct&#xD;
      Fluorination (SDF) plant&#xD;
      (Fig. 1a) at their headquarters in Preston to synthesise products for&#xD;
      customers in the life science&#xD;
      industries.&#xD;
    V-FEND (Voriconazole, Pfizer, Fig. 1b) is the world-wide best-selling&#xD;
      systemic, antifungal agent&#xD;
      and has a 5-fluoropyrimidine sub-unit 1 as part of its structure.&#xD;
      Manufacture of fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      intermediate 1 had been carried out previously by multi-step,&#xD;
      resource intensive strategies&#xD;
      described by Pfizer scientists [Im3] but new Durham methods for selective&#xD;
      direct fluorination of &amp;#946;-ketoesters&#xD;
      using F2 [2] provided the opportunity for a more efficient&#xD;
      2-step process, that is far less&#xD;
      expensive and generates less waste than other procedures. Given this new&#xD;
      business opportunity,&#xD;
      Durham direct fluorination methodology [2] for the synthesis of&#xD;
      &amp;#946;-fluoroketoester 2 (Fig. 1b), as the&#xD;
      key starting material for the manufacture of 5-fluoropyrimiide system 1,&#xD;
      was developed and scaled-up&#xD;
      by F2 Chemicals and used through all the clinical trial, launch and&#xD;
      commercialization periods of&#xD;
      V-FEND by Pfizer [Im3]. In the period from January 2008 to July 2013,&#xD;
      multi-tonne quantities of F-ketoester&#xD;
      1 were manufactured by F2 Chemicals Ltd [Im2] as the exclusive&#xD;
      supplier for Pfizer using&#xD;
      Durham direct fluorination chemistry [2]. World-wide sales of V-FEND in&#xD;
      the 2008-2012 REF period&#xD;
      total $4.65 billion [Im4] making this product one of the global top 100&#xD;
      best-selling pharmaceuticals.&#xD;

&#xD;
    V-FEND's economic and societal impact arises from its use as a triazole&#xD;
      antifungal medication&#xD;
      [Im5] active against serious, invasive fungal infections such as&#xD;
      candidiasis, aspergillosis, and&#xD;
      certain emerging fungal infections [Im6]. Aspergillosis is primarily an&#xD;
      infection of the lungs caused&#xD;
      by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungus Aspergillus&#xD;
      which is commonly found growing on&#xD;
      dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation.&#xD;
      There are several forms&#xD;
      of aspergillosis: pulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to the&#xD;
      fungus that usually develops&#xD;
      in people who already have lung problems (such as asthma or cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis); aspergilloma is a&#xD;
      growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung&#xD;
      scarring (such as&#xD;
      tuberculosis or lung abscess) and pulmonary aspergillosis (invasive type)&#xD;
      is a serious infection&#xD;
      associated with pneumonia that can spread to other parts of the body. This&#xD;
      infection almost always&#xD;
      occurs in people with a weakened immune system due to cancer, AIDS,&#xD;
      leukaemia, an organ&#xD;
      transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medications that lower&#xD;
      the number of normal&#xD;
      white blood cells or weaken the immune system. For example, invasive&#xD;
      pulmonary aspergillosis&#xD;
      (IPA) is estimated to occur in 5-13% of people who have a bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant, 5-25% of&#xD;
      people with a heart or lung transplant and 10-20% of people who undergo&#xD;
      high-dose radiotherapy&#xD;
      for leukaemia.&#xD;
    Durham selective fluorination chemistry [2, Im1] has therefore played a&#xD;
      significant role in impacting&#xD;
      many patients treated by V-FEND, giving world-wide health benefits in the&#xD;
      treatment of fungal&#xD;
      infections for a wide range of disease control.&#xD;
    In order to further develop the use of Durham F2 chemistry for&#xD;
      fine chemical manufacture, a&#xD;
      Durham University spin-out company, Brock Fine Chemicals Ltd [Im7], was&#xD;
      established in April&#xD;
      2011 by Graham Sandford with assistance and legal expertise from Durham&#xD;
      Business Innovation&#xD;
      Services (DBIS). Brock (UK registered company 7610103) attracted proof of&#xD;
      concept funding&#xD;
      (&amp;#163;100K) from the NorthStar regional investment group [Im8] to further&#xD;
      exploit the use of fluorine for&#xD;
      fine chemical manufacturing, particularly for the synthesis of a range of&#xD;
      iodo-aromatic derivatives&#xD;
      using Durham fluorine-mediated iodination chemistry [4]. The company now&#xD;
      employs 2 FTE&#xD;
      chemists and associated marketing and finance expertise. It has made sales&#xD;
      of over 100 fine&#xD;
      chemical products to chemical distributors such as Fluorochem, Acros, Alfa&#xD;
      Aesar, Apollo Scientific&#xD;
      and Shigematsu since trading began. Sales in Year 1 were &amp;#163;8K growing to&#xD;
      &amp;#163;40K in Year 2 and&#xD;
      within the proof-of-concept business plan.&#xD;
    Multi-channel continuous flow microreactor techniques developed at Durham&#xD;
      [3] were patented by&#xD;
      Durham University [Im9] and a world-wide exclusive license negotiated by&#xD;
      the University (DBIS)&#xD;
      and granted to the Asahi Glass Co., Japan for a significant fee and a&#xD;
      subsequent royalty stream.&#xD;
      This acquisition formed a core part of the IP knowledge base in flow&#xD;
      reactor technology at Asahi&#xD;
      Glass.&#xD;

    Research in elemental fluorine for organic synthesis at DU was led by&#xD;
      Prof R.D. Chambers FRS&#xD;
      (Durham staff 1960-2000) and continued by Prof G Sandford (Durham staff&#xD;
      1993-present).&#xD;
      Elemental fluorine gas (F2) has long been considered to be too&#xD;
      reactive and uncontrollable for use&#xD;
      as a reagent in organic synthesis and this perception still predominates.&#xD;
      General comments in&#xD;
      standard organic chemistry textbooks such as "Direct fluorination of&#xD;
      aromatic rings with F2 is not&#xD;
      feasible at room temperature because of the extreme reactivity of F2....is&#xD;
      not yet of preparative&#xD;
      significance (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry)" are typical.&#xD;
    Despite this background, research into the use of F2 for&#xD;
      controlled organic synthesis began a new&#xD;
      phase in 1993 after encouragement from Durham led British Nuclear Fuels&#xD;
      (BNFL) to exploit its&#xD;
      expertise in handling F2 for non-nuclear purposes and to create&#xD;
      a subsidiary company, BNFL&#xD;
      Fluorochemicals Ltd (Preston, UK), later F2 Chemicals Ltd. Considerable&#xD;
      research funding from&#xD;
      the company to Durham allowed the development of a wide ranging blue-skies&#xD;
      research&#xD;
      programme into the use of F2 for organic synthesis and this&#xD;
      continues at Durham to the present.&#xD;
      Expertise was developed to overcome the many problems of using F2&#xD;
      for the safe synthesis of fine&#xD;
      chemicals. In particular, techniques involving the use of dilute F2&#xD;
      in nitrogen, appropriate solvent&#xD;
      choice (high dielectric constant media such as formic acid, sulfuric acid&#xD;
      or acetonitrile) [1], reactor&#xD;
      vessel design, gas flow regulator systems and stainless steel/monel&#xD;
      fluorine gas handling lines&#xD;
      have been developed over the years in Durham. This has allowed selective&#xD;
      direct fluorination of a&#xD;
      range of aliphatic, dicarbonyl [2], aromatic, heteroaromatic,&#xD;
      heterocyclic, steroid and carbohydrate&#xD;
      derivatives to be established and the mechanism (regiochemistry,&#xD;
      stereochemistry, selectivity) of&#xD;
      these processes to be explored. Indeed, we have shown that controlled&#xD;
      direct fluorination of&#xD;
      aromatic rings is now feasible at room temperature [1].&#xD;
    The control of F2 reactivity by promoting selective&#xD;
      electrophilic reactions using high dielectric&#xD;
      constant media [1] was particularly important, and F2 can now&#xD;
      be considered to act as a typical&#xD;
      electrophilic reagent for a range of electrophilic aliphatic and aromatic&#xD;
      substitution processes. In&#xD;
      particular, efficient direct selective fluorination processes of&#xD;
      &amp;#946;-dicarbonyl and &amp;#946;-ketoester&#xD;
      substrates were established for the first time using acetonitrile or&#xD;
      formic acid as reaction media [2]&#xD;
      to give various fluoro-dicarbonyl and fluoro-ketoester systems in high&#xD;
      yield.&#xD;
    Further control of selective fluorination reactions was achieved by the&#xD;
      design, fabrication and&#xD;
      commissioning of single and multi-channel continuous flow reactor systems,&#xD;
      establishing the use of&#xD;
      convenient and inexpensive flow reactors for gas/liquid processes in the&#xD;
      laboratory [3]. Key new&#xD;
      techniques for the supply of individual gas (F2) and liquid&#xD;
      reagents from single sources to a parallel&#xD;
      array of many flow channels at the same flow rate and pressure whilst&#xD;
      maintaining laminar flow&#xD;
      within the reactor channels were incorporated into the reactor designs.&#xD;
    Fluorine gas can also be used an enabler of other chemical&#xD;
      transformations. For example, reaction&#xD;
      of fluorine in situ with iodine leads to iodine monofluoride which&#xD;
      has been used in highly efficient&#xD;
      electrophilic iodination processes [4] within acidic reaction media for&#xD;
      the synthesis of iodoaromatic&#xD;
      systems directly from corresponding aromatic substrates.&#xD;

    CASTEP can be used to simulate a wide range of materials including
      crystalline solids, surfaces, molecules, liquids and amorphous materials.
      It can calculate the properties of any material that can be thought of as
      an assembly of nuclei and electrons with the only limitation being the
      finite speed and memory of computers systems [C1, see Fig 1]. Applications
      include:
    
      Device technologies: modelling materials for new semiconductor devices
        including nanoparticles, high dielectric constant materials,
        data-storage materials
      Geology: elastic, thermal and dynamical properties of Earth and
        planetary material under extreme conditions
      Spectroscopy: Interpretation of experimental studies in a wide variety
        of spectroscopic techniques such as Raman, Infra-red, nuclear magnetic
        resonance, electron energy loss spectroscopy, neutron spectroscopy
      New light emission materials: Investigations on liquid crystals, light
        emitting polymers, light emitting semiconducting materials all used in
        new display technologies
      Structure prediction: investigations of the structures of new
        materials ranging from pharmaceuticals and life-science molecules to
        semiconductors, spintronics and complex metals.

    The reputation of the code was such that the authors were approached by
      Accelrys Inc, a NASDAQ-quoted research and development software company
      based in San Diego, USA, which employs over 360 people and has an annual
      turnover of $81M [C2]. They proposed licensing the software so they could
      market it for scientific, industrial and technological applications.
      Accelrys incorporated CASTEP into its Materials Studio modelling and
      simulation platform which has been bought by over 800 companies worldwide
      [C3], making this the best selling software package of its type. These
      include some of the largest manufacturers in the chemical (e.g. Unilever),
      pharmaceutical, automobile (e.g. Toyota, General Motors) and aviation
      (e.g. Boeing) sectors, as well as smaller scale high-tech science
      companies, testifying to the commercial viability of the product across a
      wide spectrum of business sizes and sectors [C3].
    Research into the effectiveness of CASTEP, sponsored by Accelrys, found
      that customers were able to recoup their investment in software tools up
      to ten times over. The major cost savings in applying computer simulations
      to the research and development of materials were from circumventing the
      need for costly experiments and shorter developmental timescales.[C4]
    The code is deeply embedded in industry, so its full impact is not
      possible to quantify, especially as much of the information is
      commercially sensitive. However, an Accelerys survey of patents based on
      CASTEP shows that 83 have been published since 2008 [C5]. Examples include
      one filed by the Tokyo-based OKI Electric Industry Co. Ltd which is
      pioneering a method of forming a gate recess in a semiconductor device.
      Another of the patents was issued in 2010 to the German-US chemicals giant
      Kronos International Ltd for an invention relating to titanium dioxide
      pigment particles and methods for their manufacture.
    Sales of Castep are producing an annual return of &amp;#163;2.5m to Accelerys,
      with total sales in excess of $30M [C3]
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Durham researcher, Prof Stewart Clark, is one of the six original
      co-developers of the Castep software package which calculates the
      electronic, physical and chemical properties of materials from first
      principles. Castep was written to solve a variety of research problems
      from semiconductor devices and liquid crystal displays, to the behaviour
      of Earth minerals under very high pressure, molecular dynamics and
      biological systems. The software package was commercialised for use in
      industry under license by Accelrys Inc., where it is bought and used by
      ~1000 high-tech companies for development of new materials in chemical,
      pharmaceutical, auto and jet engine manufacturing industries. Total sales
      revenue for Accelerys from the Castep code is in excess of $30M.

    The properties of materials can be predicted from first principles from
      their electronic structure, but these are prohibitively time consuming to
      calculate from a basic wavefunction approach. Instead, density functional
      theory is a much more powerful technique to solve many body problems in
      quantum mechanics (winning the 1999 Nobel prize for Walter Kohn). This
      gives the energy levels and wavefunction of the material, but the more
      useful information is how it responds e.g. to light, phonons, neutrons etc
      as this is directly measureable and has a direct connection to
      applications for the material. Typically this response is determined by
      the second derivative of the energy, which requires perturbative methods.
      In the late 1990s there were existing codes which used the density
      functional approach to calculate wavefunctions and energies, but these
      were all developed for specific applications by multiple authors and were
      not efficient enough to extend to perturbation theory. They were also
      typically poorly documented, and difficult to port onto the new parallel
      computing environments which were beginning to appear.
    Prof Stewart Clark (member of Durham Physics Department 1997-present),
      together with a small group of theoretical condensed matter physicists,
      decided that the lack of efficient computational tools was a serious
      barrier to their research and that they should build a new code from the
      ground up. Their code was fundamentally designed to run on parallel
      machines, and be fully documented so that additional functionality could
      easily be incorporated by external researchers as well as the authors. The
      original CASTEP Developers Group consisted of Stewart Clark (Durham), Phil
      Hasnip, Mike Payne and Chris Pickard (Cambridge), Matt Probert (York) and
      Matt Segall (now in industry). While these are all credited as equal
      co-authors, Prof Clark's contribution included development of the new,
      efficient computational implementation of the density functional theory
      which forms the heart of the CASTEP code [1-2]. He also developed a new,
      much more computationally efficient way to solve the non-local
      interactions between electrons [3], which he has recently updated [4].
    The first public release of CASTEP was in 2001, and Prof Clark
      immediately used this to tackle his research problems, including how to
      circumvent the miniaturization limit for transistors. Standard silicon
      dioxide materials hit a quantum limit below 22 nm as electrons start to
      tunnel through the transistor gate so the device is no longer a reliable
      switch. Prof Clark used CASTEP to calculate the properties of numerous
      alternative semiconductor materials, and showed that quantum tunnelling
      was much less of an issue for Halfnium dioxide, so chips made using this
      material could be made much smaller [5]. The same year, Intel
      independently released its first chip based on Halfnium dioxide,
      demonstrating that this did indeed allow miniaturization as predicted by
      CASTEP.
    Another research project was with multi-ferroic materials. In general,
      materials can be either ferro-magnetic or ferro-electric but not both as
      ferro-magnetism occurs when spin degeneracy is lifted by pushing electrons
      to unfilled states, whereas ferro-electric materials push electrons
      towards filled states so the two are generally mutually exclusive.
      However, a very small number of materials do show both, and these are very
      important both for the intriguing science underlying the phenomena, and
      the exciting potential of devices where both the magnetic and charge
      properties can be controlled. Of these, BiFeO3 is one of the
      few to exhibit this behaviour at room temperature, as required for device
      applications. Prof Clark was able to use CASTEP to explain how the
      electronic structure of BiFeO3 allowed this to happen. This
      fundamental understanding of the underlying physics is a prerequisite to
      precise control of the behaviour of the material in spintronics (magnetic
      switching) devices [6].
    CASTEP can also tackle fundamental issues in biology such as the topology
      of molecular networks. These are extremely difficult to calculate but
      critically determine all the material properties, including chemical
      bonding and crystallization. Prof Clark was able to use CASTEP's accurate
      electronic structure calculations to predict the three major crystalline
      structures of glycine, the first amino acid for which this was possible,
      and to show that another could exist at higher pressure [7].
    The Developers Group continuously update the code to add functionality
      such as modules to calculate the results of Raman spectroscopy and nuclear
      magnetic resonances. This makes the code a unique resource, allowing
      communication and collaboration between experimentalists and theorists, in
      both industry and academia, increasing its impact and scope significantly.
    Over 4000 peer-reviewed publications across a wide range of disciplines
      have used the code. It is also used in training highly skilled graduate
      students, many of whom have gone on to work in industry. Several hundred
      PhD theses from 2002 to the present have been based on calculations using
      CASTEP, contributing to the large number of scientific papers published in
      leading peer reviewed international journals.

    Cross and Freeman had very early realised that there were multiple
      commercial uses within the surface science and biophysics communities of
      this new, very sensitive measurement device. They co-founded Farfield
      Sensors in 1997, and filed patents for the original design ideas [P1-P2].
      By 2002 they had developed this into a commercial product, the AnaLight
      Bio200, a Dual Polarization Interferometer (DPI) for the measurement of
      real-time structural change in molecular systems [C1]. This won the
      National Physical Laboratory National Measurement Award 2003 for
      Innovation in Measurement, recognising Farfield's technical innovation and
      impact on current industrial metrology, as well as a suite of other awards
      [C2]. The company moved to purpose built premises in Crewe [C1], and in
      2008 they launched a second generation instrument design, the AnaLight 4D
      which could quantify the degree of order and disruption in lipid bilayers
      as well as measure molecular dimensions and density on surfaces. This new
      tool generated substantial interest and the company doubled its turnover
      in 2008, having its best year ever [C3]. It extended its customer base to
      17 countries, recruiting a new Far East agent and a new member of the core
      scientific staff [C1].
    Two of the machines were bought by P&amp;amp;G, a US company with $80Billlion
      turnover in consumer products. An example project was to test different
      dishwasher detergents for their rinse time. A faster rinse reduces the
      water usage, leading to environmental gains, but the detergent needs to be
      completely removed in order to leave glasses `squeaky clean', a criteria
      which is especially important in Japan. P&amp;amp;G used the DPI to
      characterise the maximum surface layer of detergent required for it to be
      classed as `squeaky clean' (the first reliable automated predictive test
      for this), and so were able to develop faster rinse formulations. The
      Analytical GCO, P&amp;amp;G Newcastle, identified the impact to the company `As
        a result, 2 head counts in Product Design were freed up to do other
        work. More importantly, the insights gained via understanding the phase
        behaviour at interfaces explains why some formulations rinse off more
        slowly than others...faster rinsing formulations for Japan Joy have been
        identified and launched in the market and keep our business in Japan
        growing.' [C4]
    Applications in biophysics include drug discovery and development as the
      instrument is sensitive enough to track the response of a protein to a
      potential drug in real time and without any additional tagging of the
      molecules which could disrupt the response. Farfield was a partner in the
      3 year European FP7 program ASMENA (2008-11) to develop new platforms for
      drug screening and analytical profiling based on in vitro measurements of
      the functional and conformal change in membrane proteins [C5]. Similar
      pan-European projects include the SABIO collaboration to develop a
      diagnostic test for Hepititis A, B and C [C6], and the INTOPSENS project,
      funded under the FP7 HealthCompetence programme, to demonstrate a compact
      polymer and silicon-based CMOS-compatible photonics sensor system for a
      rapid diagnostic test for sepsis at `point of care' [C7]. They are also
      part of the NEURASYNC network to study Parkinson's disease (PD). This is
      the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized
      pathologically by the accumulation of aggregated conformations of the
      presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein. Farfield's role was to use the
      AnaLight DPI for state of the art in vitro assays with biomarkers and
      experimental therapeutics targeting alpha-synuclein [C8].
    In 2009, the company took its sensor fabrication to Inex, at
      Newcastle-upon-Tyne in order to move from a 4" to a 6" process and it
      extended its range of chip surfaces. It was accepted into the North West
      England High Growth business support programme. There was expansion of
      bioscience-based sales activity in the form of a co-marketing agreement
      with IdentiGen in Germany and the customer base extending to 19 countries
      with first-time installations in Korea and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
      [C1]. The company took on a new postdoc in 2010 and launched the Farfield
      AnaLight 4D Workstation, allowing combined studies of affinity,
      kinetics, conformation and thermodynamics of biomolecules (Fig 4 [C9]).

	  Fig 3: AnaLight 4D workstation
	  
    However, the worsening economic climate brought difficulties for the
      company and it was bought out in April 2010 by the publically quoted
      Swedish scientific instrument supplier Biolin Scientific, who acquired all
      existing shares in the Farfield Group for &amp;#163;2.5M [C10]. Farfield continued
      to market and sell under the Farfield brand worldwide, remaining a
      separate product company within the Biolin organisation. All Farfield
      staff were retained after the acquisition [C10] and, indeed, three new
      core staff, a Product development Manager, a Business development Manager
      and an application specialist, were subsequently recruited [C11].
      Iberlaser SA took on representation of Farfield in Spain, and Farfield
      relocated to new premises at Manchester Airport with improved laboratory
      and training facilities. Automation was enhanced during the year with the
      Dual Plate Autosampler, the customer base expanded to 20 countries, and
      Biolin Inc, the US division of Biolin, took on a new post-doctoral
      scientist to support the Dual Polarisation Interferometry. However, Biolin
      took the strategic decision to discontinue the manufacture and sales of
      the Dual Polarisation Interferometer on December 30th 2011, though the
      company has made the commitment to support existing customers up till the
      end of December 2016 [C12].
    Despite its demise, the instrument nevertheless has made a significant
      contribution to biosensing and the surface science sectors, and there
      remain scores of instruments in use around the world.

    Research in Durham Physics Department on optical waveguides was used to
      build a novel interferometer which can measure real time changes in
      dimension and density of a thin film adsorbed on a sensor chip. This has
      multiple applications in surface science and biophysics, e.g. in measuring
      conformal and other structural changes in proteins as they interact with
      drug candidate molecules. The device was developed as a commercial product
      by a spin-out company, Farfield Sensors, which sold the interferometers to
      research institutes and industry. The Farfield Group was bought in 2010 by
      Biolin Scientific for &amp;#163;2.5M.

    Dr Graham Cross has longstanding research interests in optical waveguide
      photonic devices. In the late 1990's he was experimenting with waveguides
      made from new polymeric materials which had just become available as these
      have lower dielectric permittivity and so can carry higher bandwidth
      signals. He was approached by Mr Neville Freeman from GEC-Marconi, who was
      also using polymers but for a rather different application in vapour
      sensing. He was using the change in polymer conductivity to measure the
      amount of gas absorbed, but found that this was neither sensitive nor
      robust. Instead, he wanted to try to use the change in refractive index of
      the polymer to trace the gas absorption. Interferometry is the most
      sensitive way to measure the change in any optical property and Dr Cross's
      waveguide work immediately suggested a practical experimental technique.
      Dr Cross designed a system where each waveguide was a water absorbing
      polymer, separated by an insulating layer of water impervious polyolefin,
      all mounted on a layer of glass. Each waveguide disperses the light at the
      end, so they act as a Young's slit experiment. As the upper layer is
      exposed to water vapour, its refractive index changes and the phase of the
      light in the upper waveguide changes relative to that in the lower
      reference beam. This offset in the interference fringes in the far field
      (hence the company name) gives a very sensitive and robust way to measure
      the amount of water vapour absorbed onto the top polymer, to the extent
      that it could be followed in real time [1].
    The initial device was specific to water as the polymer would not
      necessarily absorb other substances of interest. However, Dr Cross
      realised that the idea could be extended to any material as the light
      field is not wholly confined within the waveguide but decays exponentially
      away from the boundary. This part of the optical field, known as the
      evanescent (vanishing) field, will interact with any ultra-thin film of
      material placed on top of the upper waveguide via exciting bound or
      partially bound optical modes. The interaction alters the speed of
      propagation ("phase velocity") in the sensing waveguide relative to the
      lower reference waveguide, again giving an offset to the interference
      fringes. This meant that the polymer materials were not required at all
      for the waveguides, and more robust structures could be built from silicon
      oxy-nitride. (Fig 1, [2]).
	  
	  Fig 1 Schematic design for the instrument with silicon oxynitride layer waveguides
	  
	  	  
	  Fig 2: Change in response with polarization state
	  
    However, Dr Cross also realised that the optical modes excited by the
      evanescent wave interaction are different for different polarization
      modes, and this difference can be used to derive the absolute thickness of
      the ultra-thin layer (Fig 2). The final design then includes a
      ferroelectric liquid crystal rotator between the illuminating laser and
      waveguide stack to act as a switchable half wave plate. The two
      polarization measures are taken at a typical rate of 50Hz, tracking
      thickness of the layer on timescales of 20ms [2]. Fast tracking of
      changing shape is especially important for biomolecules, as the shape of
      proteins is as important as their chemical composition in determining
      their characteristics. This paper demonstrated the technique by measuring
      the thickness of an adsorbed layer of the rigid protein streptavidin as it
      developed in real time [2].
    The techniques are equally important in surface science applications. The
      team used a thin film of tetraethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E14),
      a well characterized non-ionic surfactant which is commonly used in
      industrial formulations, and showed that the adsorbed layer thickness
      increases as the surfactant concentration increases. This suggests that
      the surfactant molecules adopt a prone attitude at low concentrations,
      resulting in thin, relatively dense layer coverage, changing to a more
      upright stance at higher concentrations. This is in good agreement with
      previous neutron reflection results [3]. The sensitivity is such that it
      can also be used to follow the surface changes during formation of a layer
      of liquid crystal [4].

During the project, work by Fossati, a Durham PhD (2008-2013) student under Tanner's&#xD;
supervision, established that the prototype XRDI system developed by Bede Scientific/Jordan&#xD;
Valley gave diffraction images which gave comparable results to those taken using white beam&#xD;
synchrotron radiation at the large facilities [5]. These smaller instruments could assess the failure&#xD;
probability of a 300(450) mm diameter wafers in 15(40) minutes [5], making this a commercially&#xD;
feasible scanner system for an industrial semiconductor wafer fab.&#xD;
As a result of the research, Jordan Valley Semiconductors UK made the strategic decision in&#xD;
2011 to invest in design, development and manufacture of clean-room compatible X-ray Diffraction&#xD;
Imaging tools for off-line inspection of all wafers. They developed both transmission (QC-TT) and&#xD;
reflection (QC-RT) geometry systems (Fig 4), but the smaller footprint (and hence lower price) of&#xD;
the QC-RT system makes it more attractive. Prior to this, potential customers had resisted&#xD;
purchase of such tools on the grounds that the instruments revealed edge defects from handling&#xD;
but were incapable of determining which defects were critical and which were benign. With the&#xD;
additional capability of accurate defect identification, achieved by incorporating image recognition&#xD;
software and the predictive model derived by the SIDAM consortium, Jordan Valley&#xD;
Semiconductors now market an: "X-Ray Diffraction Imaging (XRDI) inspection system that detects&#xD;
crystalline defects in patterned and blanket wafers [which will]&#xD;
&#xD;
Identify cracks which will cause breakage BEFORE the breakage occurs&#xD;
Detect slip, which may cause overlay issues, on 300mm wafers in minutes&#xD;
Identify dislocations on wafers during manufacture without dislocation etching&#xD;
Full 300mm scanning, with rapid coarse reflection scans of either the full wafer area or&#xD;
selected regions&#xD;
Can mount part 450mm wafers&#xD;
Monitoring of defects down to single dislocations.... at any doping and wafer backside&#xD;
treatment.&#xD;

Capability for a wide range of crystalline substrates" [C1]&#xD;
&#xD;
The importance of these tools was recognised at the annual SEMICON West exhibition held in&#xD;
San Francisco in July 2012 and attended by 29,263 people. The 2012 "Best of West" award was&#xD;
presented to Jordan Valley Semiconductor UK Ltd. for the QC-TT defect inspection system. "The&#xD;
Best of West Award is given to recognize important product and technology developments in the&#xD;
microelectronics industries....based on the submission's financial impact on the industry,&#xD;
engineering or scientific achievement, or societal impact and benefits" [C2]. The CEO of Jordan&#xD;
Valley Semiconductor (the parent company) said, "One thing I'm really proud of is that it [the&#xD;
system] was developed in the U.K. It's hitting significant needs for 300-millimeter and 450-&#xD;
millimeter [wafers]." [C2]&#xD;
In January 2013, The Vice President Corporate and UK Site Manager of Jordan Valley&#xD;
Semiconductors (UK), said: "We have sold [text removed for publication] XRDI systems in the last&#xD;
2 years, into 4 different countries with a total value of approximately &amp;#163;M [text removed for&#xD;
publication]. At least 2 of these systems are for production lines, and we anticipate repeat sales for&#xD;
these1 along with other production line sales to other companies. Without the involvement in the&#xD;
SiDAM project, led by Durham University, it is unlikely the XRDI technique would have been&#xD;
developed into a product of value for the semiconductor industry. The interest gained from the&#xD;
SiDAM project, including [from] the industrial partners, [was] critical in deciding to invest&#xD;
significantly in the development of these products.&#xD;
The addition of these products has been critical in the growth of JV-UK in the last 2 years, both&#xD;
financially (from administration to &amp;gt;$6M revenues and profitable in 2011) and in the number of&#xD;
employees (from 25 to 28 in the last year with plans to hire an additional 2 employees in the next 6&#xD;
months). They have been instrumental in decreasing the reliance of the company on a single&#xD;
market."[C3]&#xD;
An assessment of the impact on the industry can be construed from the fact that&#xD;
semiconductor companies are now investing in X-ray Diffraction Imaging tools in order to reduce&#xD;
the number of catastrophic wafer failures occurring [C2]. It is estimated by the industry body,&#xD;
SEMATECH, that for every silicon fabrication line producing 20,000 300mm or 50,000 200 mm&#xD;
wafers per month, the cost of catastrophic wafer failure during high temperature processing is $2M&#xD;
per annum at the 180nm node, rising to over $25M per annum at the 47nm node [C5]. The cost&#xD;
continues to rise as the inverse square of the node size. One of the leading semiconductor&#xD;
manufacturers, Toshiba, began shipping flash memory NAND gates based on 24nm technology as&#xD;
early as August 2010 and since April 2012, Intel has been shipping microprocessors based on&#xD;
22nm technology. Even a fractional reduction in the number of failures thus has huge economic&#xD;
significance. The Intel representative on the SIDAM Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) said&#xD;
"Attendance at the IAB gave a new understanding of the issue which shows the industry how to&#xD;
solve it. Personally I think that the SIDAM research consortium, led by Professor Tanner, has&#xD;
transformed an interesting X-ray technique into a powerful tool for the assessment of the risk of&#xD;
wafer breaks at high temperature processing steps" [C6].&#xD;

</ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
Semiconductor wafers are subject to damage from misaligned handling tools, leading to cracks.&#xD;
Most of these are benign, but a few propagate to cause silicon wafer breakage during high&#xD;
temperature processing, leading to losses in production time costing millions of dollars per year.&#xD;
Research in Durham showed that X-ray Diffraction Imaging can be used to identify which cracks&#xD;
will catastrophically fail. As a consequence, Jordan Valley UK Ltd has designed and already sold&#xD;
over &amp;#163;M [text removed for publication] worth of X-ray imaging tools to the semiconductor industry.&#xD;
The company identifies this product as being critical to its continuation, safeguarding more than 25&#xD;
jobs, and growth over the past 2 years.&#xD;

An X-ray tool for the prediction of catastrophic failure during semiconductor&#xD;
manufacture (Jordan Valley)&#xD;
</Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Physics</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>&#xD;
Brittle fracture is a stochastic process and&#xD;
confident prediction of the probability of propagation&#xD;
of a specific crack even under accurately controlled&#xD;
stresses represents a huge challenge. Most studies&#xD;
of fractures rely predominantly on a statistical&#xD;
approach, and the few attempts at a deterministic&#xD;
model suggest that crack length is a key parameter,&#xD;
but that other factors such as location and the&#xD;
detailed form of the applied stress were also&#xD;
important. This has commercial applications in&#xD;
semiconductor manufacturing, where catastrophic&#xD;
silicon wafer breakage during high temperature &#xD;
processing is an increasingly expensive hazard (Fig &#xD;
1). Most silicon wafers show damage due to&#xD;
handling in the manufacturing process, yet only a few of these propagate to cause catastrophic&#xD;
failure during rapid thermal annealing, so it is not economic to simply remove all damaged wafers.&#xD;
What is required is a way to distinguish which cracks are critical and which are benign.&#xD;
	  &#xD;
	  Fig 1. Catastrophic fracture of a 200mm diameter silicon wafer&#xD;
	  &#xD;
Physically, a crack will propagate where the opening stress on the crack is larger than the back&#xD;
stress at its tip, but neither of these quantities can be measured easily from standard images. In&#xD;
January 2008, a research consortium led by Durham University, and coordinated by Professor&#xD;
Brian Tanner of the Physics Department, began work to develop a method of predicting which&#xD;
wafers were at risk using X-ray Diffraction Imaging (XRDI, also known as X-ray topography) to&#xD;
assess the damage due to handling on the wafers. Unlike normal imaging, XRDI measures the&#xD;
residual strain on the material as a diffraction image is sensitive to the change in lattice plane&#xD;
spacing.&#xD;
The international consortium included both academic (Durham, Freiburg, Dublin City and&#xD;
Navarra Universities) and industrial partners, funded under a &amp;#8364;2M European Commission&#xD;
Framework 7 ICT project, `Investigation of Silicon wafer damage in manufacturing processes'&#xD;
(SIDAM) [1] ran from 2008-2011. It was strongly supported by major semiconductor companies,&#xD;
with an advisory board which included representatives from Intel, MEMC, Siltronic and AMD&#xD;
(Global Foundaries). The SME industrial partner was Bede Scientific Instruments Ltd., a 30 year-&#xD;
old spin-out from Durham University Physics Department that had floated as Bede plc on the&#xD;
London Stock Exchange in 2000. This was acquired by the Israeli company Jordan Valley&#xD;
Semiconductors in April 2008 and rebranded as its new UK subsidiary, Jordan Valley&#xD;
Semiconductors (UK) Ltd. This took the place of Bede Scientific in the consortium.&#xD;
By working closely with advisory board members, the consortium established that misaligned&#xD;
handling tools generated cracks at the edge of Si wafers. The team were able to reproduce this&#xD;
pattern of cracking in a controlled manner using nano-indentation close to the wafer edge. These&#xD;
`control' wafers were studied at high resolution using the XRDI at the Diamond Light Source (see&#xD;
Fig 2 and [2]). The key research breakthrough was in 2011, led by Prof Tanner of Durham&#xD;
University, where he showed that the crack propagation condition could be simply assessed as the&#xD;
length of the crack was a measure of the opening stress, while the width of the crack tip on the&#xD;
XRDI measures the back stress [3]. Cracks with a small length to image width ratio are benign;&#xD;
those with a large length to image width are highly likely to lead to fracture. This condition can be&#xD;
used predict whether a crack will or will not propagate under specific thermal processing conditions&#xD;
(see Fig 3). The team confirmed the basic mechanism of crack propagation using in-situ&#xD;
experiments conducted at the ANKA synchrotron radiation source [4].&#xD;
	  &#xD;

    In 2003, with venture capital from Prof. Max Robinson, a business angel&#xD;
      who was at that time a member of the Durham University Technology Transfer&#xD;
      team, the intellectual property was licensed to a spin-out company, Durham&#xD;
      Scientific Crystals, subsequently renamed Kromek, in order to directly&#xD;
      exploit the new vapour growth process. Supplemented by a DTI SMART award,&#xD;
      the first commercial crystal growth facility was established in the&#xD;
      company's first premises in the Mountjoy Research Centre, which was then&#xD;
      the University business incubator. There were initially two staff members,&#xD;
      Drs Arnab Basu and Ben Cantwell, both of whom had just completed their&#xD;
      PhDs with Prof Brinkman in the Physics Department in Durham. The company&#xD;
      rapidly outgrew its original accommodation and moved to NETPark (North&#xD;
      East Technology Park), Sedgefield in 2005. Continued growth necessitated a&#xD;
      move to larger, purpose built premises in NETPark (see Fig 1 &amp;amp; 2),&#xD;
      opened by Prince Andrew in 2010 [C1]. The company now employs over 50&#xD;
      people, including several sub-contractors, at NETPark.&#xD;

	  	  &#xD;
    The business model initially focused on the growth of large, high purity&#xD;
      CdTe and CdZnTe crystals for sale to other companies building X-and&#xD;
      gamma-ray detectors or infrared imaging systems. However, the company&#xD;
      then took the strategic decision to move up the product value chain by&#xD;
      fabricating their own imaging detectors, incorporating ASIC (Application&#xD;
      Specific Integrated Circuit) electronics. The potential of these attracted&#xD;
      &amp;#163;1M investment in 2005 from Amphion, the UK arm of a US venture capital&#xD;
      company investing in high tech start-up companies. Subsequent calls for&#xD;
      venture capital resulted in investment of over &amp;#163;24M, with a round in 2009 raising &amp;#163;12.3M [C2].&#xD;
    To ensure direct supply of the ASIC technology, Kromek bought Nova&#xD;
      R&amp;amp;D in 2010, an electronics company employing 13 staff at its&#xD;
      Riverside, California base [C3]. In June 2011, Kromek and Nova held 34&#xD;
      granted patents. In February 2013, Kromek acquired Endicott Interconnect&#xD;
      Detection and Imaging Systems (EIDS), based in Saxonburg, PA, USA in a&#xD;
      strategic move to consolidate the market in melt-grown CdZnTe material.&#xD;
      This acquisition added another 40 staff, 25 patents and 300 trade secrets&#xD;
      to the Kromek Group. EIDS is now trading again as eV Products [C4].&#xD;
    Initially the company explored applications in the medical imaging market&#xD;
      where there are multiple applications for colour X-ray imaging. Kromek had&#xD;
      a $1.5M contract from the US National Institute for Health to develop an&#xD;
      advanced X-ray camera for breast cancer detection, building on expertise&#xD;
      developed from an earlier contract with Siemens to build pixelated X-ray&#xD;
      detectors for computerised tomography (CT) scanners [C5]. However,&#xD;
      security systems presented even more opportunities with new requirements&#xD;
      for screening airport carry-on baggage since 9/11. Supported by the UK&#xD;
      Home Office and its investors, the company incorporated their detectors&#xD;
      into X-ray systems for liquid explosive detection. In 2008 (the same year&#xD;
      it was awarded the ISO2001 manufacturing quality stamp) it launched a&#xD;
      bottle scanner which can deal with individual containers. The system, now&#xD;
      in use at airports around the world, has a direct impact on all airline&#xD;
      passengers as it allows duty free liquids to be carried through airport&#xD;
      security screens [C6]. The liquid scanning system (see Fig 3) readily&#xD;
      distinguishes Coca-Cola from Pepsi, and was awarded the&#xD;
      newly created Standard 3 for Liquid Explosive Detection Systems (LEDS)&#xD;
      following recent regulatory trials (August 2013). Kromek Chief Executive&#xD;
      Officer, Dr Arnab Basu said: ''This achievement, together with a 20%&#xD;
        reduction in scan time, design changes that include a much faster and&#xD;
        simpler user interface, and a roadmap to further reduce the scanning&#xD;
        time by 50% put Kromek's explosives detection equipment ahead of the&#xD;
        pack.....What makes the Identifier unique is its ability to scan metal&#xD;
      cans, Tetra Pak and foil pouches, in addition to all types of glass&#xD;
      and plastic containers; this means the Kromek Identifier is the only&#xD;
        ECAC Standard 3 approved system that can scan every container type with&#xD;
        a simple one button operation." [C7]&#xD;
  	  &#xD;

    The company went from winning regional awards in 2007 (Business Link&#xD;
      North East Business award, Business Innovation Centre), to national&#xD;
      competitions in 2008 (IET Innovation award), and European success in 2009&#xD;
      (Western Europe Global Security Challenge for Best Security SME). This&#xD;
      series culminated in the $400,000 Global Security Challenge award in 2009&#xD;
      for Best Security SME, while Dr Arnab Basu, now Kromek's CEO, won the 2009&#xD;
      Ernst and Young title of UK Young Entrepreneur of the Year [C8].&#xD;
    Other security applications use CdZnTe (CZT) crystals for gamma-ray&#xD;
      detection systems. In 2010 the company won a $4M contract with the US&#xD;
      Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) to develop detectors for&#xD;
      radioactive materials as part of its on-going anti-terrorist measures&#xD;
      [C9], and the resulting products are also on sale as handheld radiation&#xD;
      monitors e.g. Kromek's GR1 detectors (Fig 4) which are in use at Fukushima&#xD;
      for decommissioning the nuclear plant [C10]. These can be combined with a&#xD;
      wall climbing, radio controlled robot to provide nuclide identification in&#xD;
      hard-to-reach, high-risk environments where safety is paramount (Fig 5).&#xD;
      The company has also developed a home radiation monitor, RadAngel, which&#xD;
      can be used with most iOS or Windows devices. This product was launched in&#xD;
      Japan in July 2012 and is now available directly to consumers for around&#xD;
      $2000 (Fig 5). Other Kromek products [C11] include the RayMon10 handheld&#xD;
      radiation monitor and isotope identifier, and RadViz a CZT based gamma ray&#xD;
      camera that enables remote nuclear characterisation with 3D dose mapping&#xD;
      capability for the nuclear industry. Kromek was awarded a further $3.5M&#xD;
      from the DTRA in collaboration with Northrop Grumman.&#xD;

    Since the original company spun out, there has been continuing research&#xD;
      collaboration between the University and the company. Prof. Tanner, a&#xD;
      member of staff of the Physics Department, is the Deputy Chairman of the&#xD;
      company board and Prof Brinkman was a Kromek Director until his death in&#xD;
      2011. The company has supported PhD students, as well as staff time buyout&#xD;
      for Prof Brinkman. A former CASE student in the group, (Paul Scott), and&#xD;
      an ex-PhD student of Prof Tanner, (Alex Pym), have been employed by&#xD;
      Kromek, as is the original inventor of the growth technique, Dr. John&#xD;
      Mullins.&#xD;
    The company was valued in May 2013 (and also on 7th November)&#xD;
      at &amp;#163;74M. Turnover grew from &amp;#163;13,231 in 2006-7 to &amp;#163;2.8M in 2011-12 and&#xD;
      &amp;#163;2.7M for the year ending April 2013. It is predicted to be &amp;#163;5.07M for the&#xD;
      year ending April 2013; shipments of product and services in April 2013&#xD;
      alone reached &amp;#163;1M. The order book stood at $5.85M in May 2013. The Kromek&#xD;
      Group plc was listed on the London AIM Stock Exchange on 16th October 2013&#xD;
      at a value of &amp;#163;55M, raising &amp;#163;15M on the floatation.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Research on vapour growth of semiconductor compounds led to a key&#xD;
      breakthrough in growing large crystals which form the basis for sensitive&#xD;
      X-and gamma-ray detectors. The process was commercialised by a Durham&#xD;
      University spin-out company, Kromek Ltd., which floated on AIM at &amp;#163;55M and&#xD;
      has over 100 employees in the UK and USA. The X-ray detectors are in use&#xD;
      in Kromek's security systems for screening liquids at airports,&#xD;
      significantly reducing restrictions on duty free goods. This application&#xD;
      won the $400,000 international prize in the 2009 Global Security&#xD;
      Challenge. The company also markets gamma-ray detectors for nuclear&#xD;
      isotope identification. These have won contracts totalling $7.5M from the&#xD;
      US Defense Threat Reduction Agency and are in use at Fukushima.&#xD;

    The late Professor Andy Brinkman (member of Durham Physics department&#xD;
      from 1980-2010) led an established research group that worked on the&#xD;
      growth, characterisation and exploitation of group II-VI compound&#xD;
      semiconductors. He had a longstanding interest in CdTe and CdZnTe, which&#xD;
      form the basis of energy sensitive X-(CdTe) and gamma-ray (CdZnTe)&#xD;
      detectors, and can also be used as substrates for thermal imaging devices.&#xD;
      However, commercial applications of these were limited by problems in&#xD;
      growing large crystals. Standard melt growth processes only produce wafers&#xD;
      less than 2 inches in diameter, whereas medical imaging applications&#xD;
      require larger area detectors. While these can be made by butting several&#xD;
      smaller crystals together, this is uneconomic as the cost scales with the&#xD;
      number of crystals rather than their size.&#xD;
    Prof Brinkman (in collaboration with Profs Tanner (Durham Physics&#xD;
      1973-present) and Durose (Durham Physics 1992-2011) led a BRITE-EURAM&#xD;
      grant (1994-1997), with major academic partners including the Universities&#xD;
      of Freiburg: Germany, Athens: Greece and Ancona: Italy) to explore and&#xD;
      develop methods to improve the growth of CdTe. He realised that vapour&#xD;
      growth was not subject to the same size limitations as melt growth&#xD;
      processes, but the resulting material was largely polycrystalline as the&#xD;
      crystal growth was disrupted by the heat from the vapour source. The key&#xD;
      breakthrough in growing high perfection single crystals was made by Dr&#xD;
      John Mullins, a postdoc working with Prof Brinkman in Durham, funded by&#xD;
      the BRITE-EURAM grant. He realised that the vapour source and deposition&#xD;
      region could be thermally decoupled by using a bent tube rather than a&#xD;
      straight tube, so that the growing crystal was not heated directly by the&#xD;
      source. The first high quality CdTe crystals were grown using this&#xD;
      technique in 1997, and the process was patented in 1998 [P1]. The first&#xD;
      results were published in a peer reviewed journal in 1999 [1], with a full&#xD;
      description of the growth system in 2000 [2].&#xD;
    Research on this technique continued with &amp;#163;0.17M grant support from EPSRC&#xD;
      (2000-2003). The potential of the process became increasingly clear, and&#xD;
      development of this into a commercial product was supported by a &amp;#163;0.15M&#xD;
      PPARC PIPPS grant (2005-2006) and &amp;#163;0.93M from a DTI basic technology award&#xD;
      via EPSRC (2006-2010). This work culminated in 2007 with the&#xD;
      heteroepitaxial growth of the first high perfection wafers of CdTe with&#xD;
      good electrical qualities, using GaAs as the substrate [e.g. 3-5]. By 2009&#xD;
      they could scale this up to grow 4 inch diameter crystals of CdTe, and in&#xD;
      2011 succeeded in making similarly large crystals of CdZnTe [6].&#xD;

The diamond machining facility was established in 2006 as part of the CfAI research&#xD;
programme on precision instrumentation for large telescopes. However, the commercial&#xD;
applications of this unique facility were soon apparent, and it has been available as a specialist&#xD;
service to industry since 2008. Over 20 companies have placed contracts worth ~&amp;#163;2.0M over the&#xD;
past 5 years of operation [C1] for high precision optical and micro-optical components for a range&#xD;
of applications including opthalmics, automotive optics, microstructures for backlit displays and IR&#xD;
optics. Professor Robertson was awarded a Royal Society Industry Fellowship (2007-2010) in&#xD;
recognition of his work with industry in the field of diamond machining.&#xD;
A growing part of the market sector for precision optics is ophthalmic moulds. Typically plastic&#xD;
spectacle lenses have been produced by using thermosetting plastics cast in polished glass&#xD;
moulds. However, newer injection moulding techniques produce higher quality lenses, with higher&#xD;
accuracy over a wider range in shape. This is a disruptive technology shift as the temperatures&#xD;
required for injection moulding are not well matched to the thermal conductivity of the glass&#xD;
moulds. Instead, this requires metal moulds, for which diamond machining techniques are&#xD;
specifically applicable. This is particularly true for progressive (freeform) moulds, where the&#xD;
diamond machined products produce lenses which are far superior in quality and shape to that of&#xD;
their conventionally produced counterparts. CfAI have worked with several companies developing&#xD;
prototype moulds in Aluminium, then moving to medium wear production tooling in Nickel&#xD;
Phosphor plated moulds and are now producing hardened steel moulds using a specialized&#xD;
machining process. The steel mould lifetime is typically 10x longer than Nickel, which itself is 10x&#xD;
longer than Aluminum.&#xD;
One example of the impact of this work is the collaboration with Pixel Optics, an ophthalmic&#xD;
technology company based in Virginia, USA. They had the idea to make bifocals where the near&#xD;
vision lens was based on a liquid crystal, so could be switched on and off when required so as to&#xD;
remove the reading zone distortion that is always present with standard bifocals or progressive (no&#xD;
line bifocal) lenses. They based their near vision zone on a Fresnel lens (see Fig 1) as these can&#xD;
be made much thinner than standard optics, and can be filled with a liquid crystal, whose refractive&#xD;
index could be controlled electronically.&#xD;
The electro-active lens technology, as it was subsequently called, was developed by The&#xD;
Technology Partnership, based in Cambridge, UK who in turn contracted CfAI in 2009 to develop&#xD;
the diffractive lens manufacturing techniques. Through an 18 month, &amp;#163;350,000 contract CfAI&#xD;
developed the capability to produce an elliptical Fresnel lens machined off axis of a spherical&#xD;
standard lens mould. This unique technique was key in enabling the electro-active lens production&#xD;
and was based on the Fast Tool Servo machining techniques developed in the earlier research&#xD;
programme for the machining of the IFU components [1-6].&#xD;
The active eyewear containing the lenses is sold by Pixel Optics as the emPower! product&#xD;
range of spectacles (Fig 2), now selling in the United States for about $1,500 a pair [C2]. This was&#xD;
launched at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2011, where it was highlighted as among the&#xD;
`Best of CES2011' by PC Magazine [C3]. These successes enabled the company to raise $45M in&#xD;
financing for further development of the product. The Empower! Glasses won the extremely&#xD;
prestigious 2012 Gold Edison Award for Quality of Life for innovation and business [C4]. These&#xD;
were also named as one of 100 top technology products in the 2012 R&amp;amp;D 100 Awards, the&#xD;
equivalent of the Oscars for R&amp;amp;D. "We're truly honoured to receive an award that celebrates&#xD;
original achievement in innovation and technology," said the President and Chief Executive Officer,&#xD;
Pixel Optics. "emPower! represents a clear breakthrough in eyewear &amp;#8212; leveraging advanced&#xD;
technology to give wearers precise control over their vision for the very first time." [C5]&#xD;

&#xD;
The precision diamond machining technology developed at Durham University [1-6] has also&#xD;
been used to produce a very different type of spectacles for a very different market. There are an&#xD;
estimated 670 million people (World Health Organisation) who live in the developing world with&#xD;
poor eyesight but without the glasses they need to be able to read due in the main to the lack of&#xD;
qualified practitioners able to test eyesight and prescribe corrective eyewear individually.&#xD;
Eyejusters are a small company based in Oxford, UK that have developed a way to improve vision&#xD;
by designing spectacles that are adjustable. The principle behind this is that adjustable glasses&#xD;
can be made to accommodate the needs of a number of people with a range of prescriptions,&#xD;
allowing an individual wearer to change the power of the glasses for maximum clarity of vision.&#xD;
This is achieved by sliding two (Alvarez) lenses with a very specific shape past each other. The&#xD;
combination acts as a single lens with a changing optical path as the lenses are moved with&#xD;
respect to one another i.e. varying optical power (Fig 3). However, the shape of these lenses is&#xD;
quite challenging to manufacture. Eyejusters are using the precision machining capabilities at CfAI&#xD;
to manufacture the lens masters, which are then reproduced in lightweight, resilient, cheap plastic.&#xD;
These are assembled into glasses, with a dial to slide together two separate lenses until their&#xD;
combined focal power matches the corrective requirements of the wearers' eyes (Fig 4: C6). The&#xD;
method, known as self-refraction, has been tested in several peer-reviewed studies [C7] and has&#xD;
been the subject of fieldwork in Ghana, Nepal, Malawi, Nicaragua, China and South Africa. In&#xD;
Morocco, the company worked with Peace Corps volunteers, providing almost 800 pairs of glasses&#xD;
to young adults at 10 sites across the country [C8].&#xD;

A facility for precision diamond machining of optical components arose from research at&#xD;
Durham University to produce instruments for large telescopes, including NASA's James Webb&#xD;
Space telescope. This now provides a specialist service to industry, with contracts worth over&#xD;
&amp;#163;2.0M from &amp;gt;20 companies over the past 5 years. The users span applications including&#xD;
ophthalmics, automotive optics, microstructures for backlit displays and IR optics. An emerging&#xD;
application is the use of high precision machine metal moulds to reproduce ophthalmic lenses for&#xD;
spectacles. Examples include PixelOptics (USA) who make high-end electronically corrective&#xD;
eyewear, which has won several ophthalmic industry R&amp;amp;D awards, and Eyejusters (UK), which&#xD;
employs complex surface slide lens technology to provide low cost spectacles aimed at improving&#xD;
the lives of people in the developing world.&#xD;

Multiple industrial applications of a precision diamond machining facility&#xD;
developed for Astronomical Instrumentation (Precision Optics)&#xD;
</Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Physics</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>&#xD;
The Centre for Advanced Instrumentation (CfAI) in Durham Physics has an extensive track&#xD;
record in producing high precision instrumentation for use in Astronomical Research. They have&#xD;
zparticular expertise in building Integral Field Units (IFU's), where a wide field of view is covered by&#xD;
multiple optical lenses, each one feeding into a spectrograph slit. The data then give full spectral&#xD;
information for each pixel, as well as an overall image.&#xD;
For optical wavelengths the light from each lens is typically fed down a fibre in order to connect&#xD;
it to the spectrograph, but this approach is impractical for IR as the entire instrument has to be&#xD;
cooled to low temperatures. Instead, a new fibre-free concept, termed the `Advanced Image Slicer'&#xD;
was developed from research funded by the PPARC Rolling Grant and published by Dr Robert&#xD;
Content (member of Durham Physics from 1994-2011) in 1997 [1]. This uses powered micro-optics&#xD;
to slice the image into narrow segments, and then aligns these into a single long image which is&#xD;
sent to the spectrograph. The reduction in optics size means that the instrument can be more&#xD;
compact so it can fit into a cooler, but the increase in complexity meant they are technically difficult&#xD;
to produce.&#xD;
A research programme led by Professor David Robertson (member of Durham Physics 1996-&#xD;
present) funded by successive PPARC Rolling Grants and a PPARC PIPSS award&#xD;
(PPA/I/S/1998/00107) with Precision Optical Engineering Ltd investigated the development of&#xD;
multi-faceted metal optics specifically for applications related to IR Image Slicing Instrumentation.&#xD;
The CfAI group invested in the diamond machining technology required to produce the image slicer&#xD;
optics funded by a &amp;#163;0.5M University SRIF award, with further enhancements to the facility provided&#xD;
by a combination of continued STFC rolling grant support, &amp;#163;1.1M Regional Development Agency&#xD;
funds and &amp;#163;0.25M CfAI internal funding generated from spin-off optics manufacturing projects. New&#xD;
techniques to fabricate extremely high accuracy optical components were developed using this&#xD;
equipment. The results of this research were published by CfAI members [2-5], showing that they&#xD;
could manufacture and test complex shapes with surface form errors of 10-20nm and a surface&#xD;
roughness of 5-10nm. This is the only facility in the UK (in either University or Industry) that is&#xD;
capable of machining these types to components to such high precision.&#xD;
CfAI's expertise in this area was such that they were selected to manufacture and test an IFU&#xD;
for the Near Infrared Spectrograph, an instrument for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).&#xD;
This is NASA's successor to the Hubble space telescope and is designed to be the premier&#xD;
observatory of the next decade. The successful bid was led by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.&#xD;
(SSTL), a UK company with extensive space experience, but relied heavily on the technical&#xD;
expertise of CfAI to produce the optics. SSLT let a &amp;#163;0.47M contract to CfAI for the IFU, which was&#xD;
delivered in 2009.&#xD;

    Peter Hill's research has had three main types of impact: first, the
      research informed Hill's creation
      of cultural artefacts (his performances, recordings, writings and
      broadcasts) and helped preserve &amp;#8212;
      and in one case discover &amp;#8212; musical heritage, all of which enriched the
      cultural life of the general
      music-loving public; second, shaping musical education and performance
      interpretation of
      Messiaen's music beyond the University of Sheffield, through piano
      masterclasses, lectures,
      writings and recordings; and, third, economic impact from performances and
      recordings.
    As described above, Hill's research into Messiaen's music led to new ways
      of interpreting the
      composer's work in relation to intra-musical processes (goal direction
      versus stasis) and their
      relationship with extramusical ideas and inspirations (the relationship
      between the natural world
      and its portraiture in Messiaen's music). These new ways of thinking
      impacted on Hill's creative
      practice as a performer, both in terms of creating cultural capital &amp;#8212;
      specifically the performances
      and reissued recordings that resulted from the research &amp;#8212; and in terms of
      the particular musical
      expression that those performances take. The manifestation of this
      research in the form of Hill's
      recordings and performances is particularly significant because neither
      Messiaen nor his wife, and
      primary interpreter, Yvonne Loriod, are alive anymore. While there is a
      `school' of followers
      influenced by studying with Loriod, Hill was influenced by studying with
      Messiaen rather than his
      interpreter. Hill's exhaustive studies with, and subsequent to, Messiaen
      now means he has a
      different but equally respected and highly acclaimed interpretation.
      Hence, Hill's distinctive
      contribution to cultural life comes from the way his research enabled him
      to create distinctive
      interpretations of Messiaen's music that are received as culture- and
      life-enhancing.
    Hill's performances and recordings are widely regarded as authoritative
      interpretations and the
      touchstone for future performers, as noted by reviewers: `Few pianists
        have more authority in
        [Messiaen's] music than Hill, who studied the Catalogue with the
        composer ... He plays it with a
        fluency that extends far beyond mere technical accuracy and rhythmic
        precision. The pieces are
        thus immediately far more than abstract technical exercises, but become
        the richly coloured
        portraits from nature that Messiaen intended ...' (Guardian,
      2011). In further evidence of this
      cultural impact, his Messiaen recordings were first re-issued by Regis
      Records as a 7CD set in
      2002 (original recordings 1985-1994, Unicorn-Kanchana) and then in 2008
      reissued again by
      Brilliant Classics who chose Hill's version of the piano music for their
      complete edition of
      Messiaen's music. Moreover, Hill has the distinction of three listings in
      1001 Classical Recordings
        You Must Hear Before You Die (Universe Publishing, 2008), including
      one for Messiaen's
      Catalogue d'oiseaux (original recording, 1988-90; reissued 2002 and
      2008). In addition his
      recording of Catalogue d'oiseaux was named in The Times'
      "The Classical Collection" (2008) as
      the best recording of this work. Hill's recordings and performances are
      also a means by which this
      musical heritage is preserved. An extreme example of this is Hill's
      discovery and interpretation of
      Messiaen's previously unknown piano piece, La Fauvette Passerinette
      (Subalpine Warbler), which
      emerged during Hill's work in the Messiaen archive 2002-4 (reported in Gramophone,
      31 July
      2013), and was premiered by Hill in Sheffield, on 2 November 2013, with a
      broadcast by BBC
      Radio 3.
    The impact of Hill's work on the wider public also comes through his huge
      number and range of
      public engagement activities which include masterclasses, lectures,
      broadcast talks, discussions
      and documentaries, journalism, and pre-concert talks. The range and number
      of events is
      illustrated by Hill's schedule in Messiaen's centenary year (2008), which
      included 12 broadcasts
      (including a recital at the Messiaen Festival at La Grave, broadcast by
      Radio France), 23 public
      lectures (including Carnegie Hall, the Library of Congress, the British
      Library and the Proms),
      broadcast interviews and documentaries (including, `Debussy's year in
      1912', `Messiaen as
      teacher', and `The Golden Oriole' for BBC Radio 3, and others for CBC,
      Radio France and Radio
      New Zealand), 12 masterclasses, in addition to 10 solo and 4 duo recitals
      in Europe, North
      America and Australia. Solo recitals to non-academic audiences include: in
      2008 &amp;#8212; Boston
      University, Buxton Festival, Cardiff University Messiaen Day, La Grave
      Messiaen Festival, Leeds
      University Messiaen Day, Norwich Messiaen Weekend, Queen's Hall Edinburgh,
      RNCM Messiaen
      Weekend, MITO Festival Milan and Turin; in 2011 &amp;#8212; Boston Conservatory; Le
      Poisson Rouge, New
      York; Bristol Earth Music Festival (Radio 3); in 2012 &amp;#8212; Festival Louise
      Besette, Montreal, for which
      he received the award for Best Contemporary Recital and Best Overall
      Recital, Synaesthesia
      Festival at MONA, Hobart; in 2013 &amp;#8212; Norwegian Academy of Music, Brisbane
      Conservatorium. In
      addition, since 2008 he has given 15 performances as piano duo (with
      Benjamin Frith) and as
      pianist with numerous ensembles in performances of Messiaen's Quatuor
        pour la fin du Temps.
    Unsolicited individual testimonies and reviews attest to the highly
      prized experiences that these
      performances arouse in audiences [S3]. For example, the reviewer of a
      performance in Glasgow
      described the performance as "lyrical and poetic..., intimate...,
        meticulously expressive in its
        dynamic layering and achingly tender in the ecstatic calm of the love
        music" (The Herald, 2008).
      The Director of the SoundsNew Contemporary Music Festival remarked "...your
        recordings of
        Messiaen literally changed my life &amp;#8212; and I sincerely mean that. The
        recording of Books 1, 2 and 3
        of Catalogue...inspired me more than words can say. No one else plays
        Messiaen like you" (email
      to Hill, 2008). As another reviewer put it: `Peter Hill does not just
        give concerts, he also enriches
        one's life with perceptive introductions that illuminate the music,
        however well you may think you
        know it ...' (Yorkshire Post).
    Hill's many public lectures include those for general audiences and
      trainee music educators,
      totalling approximately 1800 people (2008-13). In 2008 alone his public
      lectures included:
      `Messiaen's use of birdsong recordings', British Library Saul lecture;
      `Messiaen', Carnegie Hall (to
      an audience of 300 people and where his co-lecturer was Pierre Boulez);
      `Messiaen's Blackbird',
      Chicago Humanities Festival; `Messiaen in War and Peace', Library of
      Congress; `Introducing
      Messiaen', MITO Festival Milan; `The composer in an age of change',
      `Messiaen and birdsong' and
      `Why music education matters', New Zealand Music Teacher's Conference;
      `Messiaen, Birdsong
      and Oiseaux Exotiques', Philharmonia Orchestra, Royal Festival
      Hall; `Messiaen's Saint Fran&amp;#231;ois
        d'Assise' (broadcast discussion), BBC Promenade Concerts, Radio 3;
      `The Crystal Liturgy', BBC
      Promenade Concerts; `Messiaen's Quartet', Queen's Hall Edinburgh. In
      illustration of the value
      placed on these activities by audience members, the organiser of the New
      Zealand Music
      Teacher's Conference remarked afterwards: "Everyone is unanimous in
        their praise for you and the
        time you spent with us. With your `wonderful communication skills with
        voice and piano' you
        convinced, converted, and indeed `motivated, encouraged and inspired'
        people to explore new
        horizons." (email to Hill, 2008).
    He has also made a conscious effort to communicate his research findings
      in an accessible way
      through written material for general audiences, such as programme notes
      and essays for the South
      Bank Messiaen Festival, February-December 2008, and booklet notes for a
      Messiaen chamber
      music CD by the Gould Trio (Hyperion), 2008. The way in which Hill's
      research influences the
      general public's understanding [S4] is illustrated by the example of the
      Saul Lecture at the British
      Library (2008), which examined Messiaen's transcriptions from birdsong
      recordings, copies of
      which are held in the British Library's sound archive, and their
      subsequent use in his music. As well
      as making connections between ornithology and music this work resulted in
      interdisciplinary
      connections between the curators of the ornithology and music recordings.
    Hill's research has also influenced later performers and interpreters of
      Messiaen's music through
      the numerous public lectures and masterclasses [S1, S2] to audiences of up
      to a hundred people
      each time at universities and conservatoires throughout Europe, North
      America and Australia.
      Some of these comprised week-long residencies in which Hill worked
      intensively with up to 20
      students at a time as well as giving public lectures and recitals. For
      instance, at the Australian
      National Academy of Music (in 2012) he coached advanced pianists in
      Messiaen's Visions de
        l'Amen (taking the second piano part himself) before giving
      performances at the Hobart
      Synaesthesia Festival, Tasmania. Participants attest to the value and
      influence of his educational
      work, one host remarking: `thank you for all your many contributions to
        the Conservatorium last
        week. For Colin the experience was priceless but for many others
        [pianists named] and all those
        who witnessed your infectious enthusiasm and boundless expertise in your
        lectures/classes/concerts, we shall remember your visit for a long time.'
      (Queensland
      Conservatorium, email to Hill, 2013) [S1].
    Hill's numerous recordings and performances also create economic
      benefits. Sales of recordings
      and tickets directly benefit record companies, and the regions and
      organisations hosting the many
      festivals at which he performs. For example, Hill provided four events to
      an audience of 400 within
      the Synaesthesia weekend festival at the Museum of Old and New Art,
      Hobart, Tasmania &amp;#8212;
      Tasmania's primary tourist attraction and part of its emerging
      `neo-economy'. More locally, Hill has
      contributed to the University of Sheffield's identity as a `Civic
      University' through his contribution to
      the success of the Sheffield Chamber Festival `Music in the Round',
      resulting in expansion of the
      Crucible Theatre studio "to accommodate a much larger audience due to
        the following built up by
        the Lindsays [String Quartet] ...placing Sheffield squarely on the
        musical map... He has truly
        enriched all who have heard him and thereby the reputation of Sheffield
        as a cultural centre."
      (Master Cutler, Sheffield)[S5].
    The constant stream of invitations to perform, coach and speak all over
      the world attest to the
      value placed on Hill's work and his reputation as someone who can
      communicate with the general
      public. Moreover it underlines Hill's commitment to communicate ideas,
      insights and knowledge
      about music to the widest audience and indicates the enrichment to quality
      of life this brings.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Peter Hill is an internationally-acclaimed scholar and pianist, and one
      of the leading authorities on
      the French 20th Century composer Messiaen. His research into
      the music of Messiaen made a
      significant contribution on an international and local level to cultural
      life and musical understanding,
      through written work for non-academic audiences, public lectures and
      master-classes, pre-concert
      and broadcast talks, and, most significantly, through the impact of that
      research on his and others'
      performances and recordings. The scale of his contribution is indicated by
      the number and range
      of public engagements, particularly during Messiaen's centenary year
      (2008), and critical acclaim
      and personal testimonies from professionals and the music-loving public.
      His work is a prime
      example of research informing performance, and enriching the cultural
      experience of the music-loving
      public beyond academia.

    Professor Peter Hill's (University of Sheffield, since 1976; Emeritus
      Professor 2009-) research
      interests have included Stravinsky, the Second Viennese School, and the
      theory of musical
      performance, but a continuing thread (since 1985) has been the French
      composer Olivier
      Messiaen &amp;#8212; one of the foremost twentieth century composers. Studies with
      Messiaen himself
      (1986-91), while recording the solo piano music, led to countless
      insights, but in particular a
      scepticism about the prevailing view of Messiaen as the composer of static
      or non-propulsive
      music (see, for example, the biography by Paul Griffiths). This
      alternative view was presented in
      three chapters in [R1] The Messiaen Companion (1995), later in
      [R2] Olivier Messiaen: Oiseaux
        Exotiques (with Nigel Simeone, 2007), and most recently in work for
      a forthcoming book on
      Messiaen's Catalogue d'Oiseaux [R4] and [R5]. This involves
      viewing Messiaen's music
      (especially post-1950) as a mosaic composed of structures that operate on
      different levels, and at
      the same time recognising the tonal centres established in the music that
      enable a sense of goal-direction.
      These ideas are key to Hill's own recordings [R6] and performances of
      Messiaen, and
      form the basis of his impact on other performers and the music-loving
      public.
    At the same time, Hill's views on the music were enhanced by unique
      access to the private
      Messiaen papers, beginning with four years researching in the composer's
      apartment in Paris
      (2001-4), followed by work on the manuscripts at the Bibilioth&amp;#232;que
      nationale de France (BnF). The
      result was [R3] Messiaen (with Nigel Simeone, 2005), the first
      biography of the composer to relate
      in detail the circumstances of Messiaen's life to the evolution of his
      music. The holdings at the BnF
      include one of the birdsong notebooks, which contain his transcriptions,
      ideas, projects and
      sketches of all types. Hill is the first scholar to have subjected these
      manuscripts to detailed
      scrutiny, and an inventory of their contents is nearing completion. Hill's
      work on the birdsong
      notebooks was the principal source for the book on Oiseaux Exotiques
      (2007), which was the first
      study to trace in detail the genesis of a work by this notoriously
      secretive composer. In addition,
      Hill's research led to his discovery and reconstruction of a previously
      unknown work, La Fauvette
        Passerinette (Subalpine Warbler), which is a substantial 15-minute
      piece for piano in the
      composer's birdsong style, dating from 1961. The piece was discovered by
      Hill among Messiaen's
      sketches, the music clearly in an advanced state of completion, with
      several pages marked "page &amp;#224;
      copier". Passages that were still in the composer's shorthand were
      reconstructed by cross-referencing
      to the notations in Messiaen's birdsong notebooks. Hill's research shed
      light on the
      origins and context of this work and its relationship to Messiaen's other
      compositions at this time
      and provides a richer understanding of Messiaen's compositional
      development.
    Understanding the sources, inspirations and evolution of Messiaen's music
      has immeasurable
      significance for performers, and &amp;#8212; like the ideas on `time' discussed
      earlier &amp;#8212; are central to Hill's
      performances and masterclasses. An illustrative example of this is the way
      understanding
      Messiaen's ornithological inspirations, including Hill's discovery of the
      recordings of birdsong used
      by Messiaen, and the evolution of birdsong into musical material in
      Messiaen's notebooks, made it
      possible to get closer to Messiaen's ideas of timbre, and to what Messiaen
      heard within the
      birdsong. Ultimately these discoveries provided insights impossible to
      obtain from the score alone.
      These findings resonate with a wider public and have played a major part
      in Hill's public lectures
      and talks (together with broadcasts) on Messiaen.

    The research work has made direct significant economic impact/benefits in&#xD;
      several key technical areas, in particular in combined uses of inverse&#xD;
      Finite Element (FE) modelling and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE),&#xD;
      biomechanics led sports footwear design and development, and application&#xD;
      of hardfacing materials for green manufacturing over the assessment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
    &#xD;
      The inverse FE modelling programs with research output 1 and other&#xD;
        developments have been successfully used to test the constitutive&#xD;
        parameters of different materials groups/systems where standard samples&#xD;
        are not readily available. The framework has made it possible to&#xD;
        integrate material testing with CAE in situations where rapid and&#xD;
        realistic material property identification is crucial. Through several&#xD;
        major enterprise projects [research projects 1-5], the developed inverse&#xD;
        FE framework has been applied in different application environments over&#xD;
        the assessment period. Typical cases include: continuous indentation&#xD;
        tests of sports materials (foams and layered structures) for sports shoe&#xD;
        design; in situ study of welded structures for car bodies and&#xD;
        micro spot-welded joints of micro thermocouples; and indentation bending&#xD;
        studies of latex rubbers/nano-composites for curing control and&#xD;
        biological tissues (bladder tissues) for simulating human prostate&#xD;
        movement and bladder filling. These applications have spread across&#xD;
        several industrial sectors including sports engineering (basketball&#xD;
        shoes), medical engineering (prostate cancer treatment) and energy&#xD;
        sectors (heat exchanger gaskets). For example, the research has led to&#xD;
        the evaluation of the feasibility of using indentation tests on extruded&#xD;
        packaging materials (plastic properties of extruded cans and plastic&#xD;
        bottles) for the Unilever (Port Sunlight Site) CAE team [source 5.1].&#xD;
        The efficiency of the top load simulation of three new packaging designs&#xD;
        has been significantly improved; the estimated reduction of simulation&#xD;
        time through confined property domain of Design of Experiment is over&#xD;
        20% [source 5.1]. The testing of biological tissues (e.g. human heel pad&#xD;
        and human skin) using the research in inverse FE modelling has directly&#xD;
        led to the development work of sports footwear, which is detailed in the&#xD;
        next section.&#xD;
      Research outputs 2 &amp;amp; 3 have been used to establish a framework of&#xD;
        combining materials, biomechanics and FE modelling for biomechanics led&#xD;
        product development, enabling the industry to develop products through&#xD;
        targeting key functional areas (e.g. protection of the 5th&#xD;
        metatarsal bone). Over the assessment period, these two outputs and&#xD;
        other associated publications have directly led to the development of&#xD;
        sports footwear based on different functional regions of the foot with&#xD;
        specific soft tissue properties and bone structures. As a result, an&#xD;
        industrial patent has been granted to the industrial user (ANTA,&#xD;
        CN102488352A, 27/12/2011-26/12/2031) to protect the intellectual&#xD;
        property of their new products. The research has produced a new natural&#xD;
        feature-based basketball shoe design. The market value for the products,&#xD;
        directly benefitting from the research work, was over &amp;#163;2m worldwide in&#xD;
        2012 [source 5.2]. The research work in biomechanics has also generated&#xD;
        significant social impact in raising the public awareness of science and&#xD;
        technology. The work has been selected as a major news release by&#xD;
        Inderscience Publisher [source 5.3] during the BBC's 2010 "Strictly Come&#xD;
        Dancing", which has been widely reported by global science and&#xD;
        technology media [source 5.3].&#xD;
      Research outputs 4-6 have advanced the development and application of&#xD;
        crack resistant hardfacing materials. Welded hardfacing is a cost&#xD;
        effective and environmentally friendly method in the repair/reclamation&#xD;
        of key engineering components/tools (such as forging dies and hot work&#xD;
        rollers) and production of duplex components. The main original research&#xD;
        development on the use of rare earth oxides [research output 4] has&#xD;
        extended welded hardfacing techniques to high value components made of&#xD;
        steels with poor weldability (e.g. high alloys steels and tool steels)&#xD;
        without an expensive full scale preheating process. With increasing&#xD;
        public concern on green manufacturing and environmental issues, such&#xD;
        technologies have been increasingly adapted by industries such as&#xD;
        mining, iron and steels production and general machineries. The research&#xD;
        work on the machining of hardfacings, cutting tool selection [research&#xD;
        output 5] and structural integrity of the welded structure [research&#xD;
        output 6] have further advanced the technologies, which is essential for&#xD;
        the application of weld hardfacing technologies. Research outputs 4-6&#xD;
        have directly led to the production of a series of new hardfacing&#xD;
        materials for different application conditions with two new application&#xD;
        patents granted since 2008 (ZL 2008-1-007-9643.4, Yang et al.,&#xD;
        22/10/2008-21/10/2028; ZL 2010-1-0236826, Yang et al.,&#xD;
        23/07/2010-22/07/2030). A company implementing the findings from these&#xD;
        research outputs has been set up in 2009, producing rare earth-based&#xD;
        welding materials. The new products and hardfacing services directly&#xD;
        benefiting from research outputs 4-6 have had an annual market worth&#xD;
        over &amp;#163;5m in 2011 and 2012 [source 5.4].&#xD;

Evidence of the quality of selected research outputs (3, 4 and 6 as&#xD;
      highlighted in bold):&#xD;
    Research outputs 3 is a key representative outcome of biomechanics&#xD;
      related research. The work combines in vivo /in situ material&#xD;
      testing of biological tissues and inverse modelling to provide important&#xD;
      data for new biomechanics led footwear designs. The investigation of&#xD;
      stresses within the human metatarsals under landing at an inversion angle&#xD;
      is the first of this nature and provides a new methodology capable of&#xD;
      integrating biomechanics, materials modelling and FE modelling to improve&#xD;
      the protection function of sports shoes in competitive games (e.g.&#xD;
      basketball, tennis and football). The findings in research outputs 3 have&#xD;
      contributed to a major product development project with a leading sports&#xD;
      footwear company, ANTA (China) [research project 6].&#xD;
    Research outputs 4 and 6 are key outcomes of continuous joint research on&#xD;
      the development of new welded hardfacing materials and their applications&#xD;
      with the Chinese Key National Laboratory of Metastable Materials Science&#xD;
      and Technology, Yanshan University, China. Research output 4 presents&#xD;
      original findings produced with the financial support from the Excellent&#xD;
      Talents Foundation of the Ministry of Machinery Industries [research&#xD;
      project 7]. This is a key original paper leading to the use of rare earth&#xD;
      oxides in welded hardfacing materials. Research output 6 was sponsored by&#xD;
      the Science and Technology Program of Hebei Province, China [research&#xD;
      project 8]. The work provides a practical method for characterising and&#xD;
      modelling stresses in the welded hardfacings incorporating key structure&#xD;
      and phase transformation. This research work and other collaborative works&#xD;
      have directly contributed to the award of a China National Natural Science&#xD;
      grant (Yang at Yanshan University, China, &amp;#163;60K, 2012-2016). X. Ren has&#xD;
      been directly involved in the original pioneering research on welded&#xD;
      hardfacings and has jointly led the project with Yang. The original&#xD;
      research on the use of rare earth oxides in crack resistant hardfacings,&#xD;
      machining of welded hardfacings, and structural integrities of hardfaced&#xD;
      components has produced a critical breakthrough in broadening industrial&#xD;
      applications of the products over the assessment period.&#xD;

    The research work in MEMARC has been conducted by effectively integrating&#xD;
      materials engineering, theoretical/ numerical modelling and product&#xD;
      development through intensive collaboration with industrial partners from&#xD;
      different sectors. The main research activities included the development&#xD;
      of a novel material characterisation methodology and the modelling of&#xD;
      materials at different scales such as atomic level, crystal nucleation and&#xD;
      microstructure. Most of the research has been developed with a clear&#xD;
      application focus or involvement of industrial partners either in the UK&#xD;
      or internationally.&#xD;
    The methods for characterising localised material properties by combining&#xD;
      experimental tests and numerical modelling have directly led to&#xD;
      applications in characterisation of sports materials [research output 1]&#xD;
      and human foot tissues in vivo. The research work in materials&#xD;
      engineering and numerical modelling has been successfully applied to&#xD;
      improve the understanding of biological systems and associated product&#xD;
      development, in particular in medical engineering and sports technologies.&#xD;
      One joint project with Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology [research project&#xD;
      1 in Section 3] has led to the modelling of the human bladder and the&#xD;
      effects of water filling level on the accuracy of radiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      of prostate cancer, which has benefited from the research work in&#xD;
      materials characterisation and modelling. Another area of application&#xD;
      oriented research [research outputs 2 &amp;amp; 3] is the investigation of&#xD;
      biomechanics of the human foot under abnormal loading conditions, which is&#xD;
      crucial for sports injury prevention. One major research theme at MEMARC&#xD;
      has been studies of the effect of landing angle on the deformation and&#xD;
      fracture of human metatarsal bones. A new concept arising from the&#xD;
      research of partitioning the soles with different materials under the&#xD;
      metatarsal bones to balance comfortableness and protection has been&#xD;
      adapted by an industrial partner in its product developments.&#xD;
    Another continuing research area [research outputs 4-6] has been on&#xD;
      materials design, modelling (thermal dynamics, phase transformation and&#xD;
      heterogeneous nucleation with rare-earth oxides), structural integrities&#xD;
      (residual stresses) and machining of welded hardfacings, which are&#xD;
      essential for promoting the application of welded hardfacing as a green&#xD;
      manufacturing technique. One major outcome has been the development of new&#xD;
      rare earth enhanced welded hardfacings that could effectively eliminate or&#xD;
      reduce the use of preheating workpiece materials of poor weldability (e.g.&#xD;
      high carbon/alloy steels). This has made the reclamation and production of&#xD;
      duplex components more material and energy effective, delivering&#xD;
      significant cost reductions. The work has found applications in a range of&#xD;
      industrial sectors, in particular the Far East where new green&#xD;
      technologies are urgently needed to be incorporated into the regional fast&#xD;
      industrial developments.&#xD;
    All of this research was either conducted at MEMARC and led and&#xD;
      principally performed by X. Ren or in collaboration with international&#xD;
      researchers. All other authors in the key papers were either PhD&#xD;
      students/PDRAs (e.g. Li (2006-2010) and Gu (2007-2011)) or&#xD;

    Agriculture&#xD;
    Artificial insemination is used principally in pig breeding, to enable&#xD;
      cost-effective and wider access to high genetic value gene pools, and&#xD;
      avoid transport of live animals with inherent risks of disease&#xD;
      transmission and the potential for stress and injury in transit. The&#xD;
      overall value in agriculture is to improve animal productivity and&#xD;
      increase the food supply. Up to 85% of swine are now bred using AI.&#xD;
      Improvements in efficiency, to which the RVC has contributed [a], have&#xD;
      resulted in lowering AI costs and expansion in its use.&#xD;
    Although bull sperm are readily recovered viably after freezing, and are&#xD;
      produced in quantity, boar sperm has not been as amenable for use in&#xD;
      commercial AI. Sperm quantity per inseminate must be sufficient to ensure&#xD;
      maximum fecundity, (which has restricted usable `doses' per ejaculate), as&#xD;
      economic value is driven by number of piglets per litter contributing to&#xD;
      total lean tonnage. Use of frozen/thawed sperm remains a small fraction of&#xD;
      the total, commercially valuable for accessing high genetic value boars&#xD;
      which deliver higher lean content in offspring. The novel formulation of&#xD;
      cryopreservation biological media that Watson's team developed, informed&#xD;
      by their research into factors affecting fresh and frozen/thawed sperm&#xD;
      competence, have become standard in pig production using frozen/thawed&#xD;
      sperm. The Knowledge Transfer Manager at the British Pig Executive (BPEX)&#xD;
      confirms: "The RVC's research has contributed to its [AI] expansion&#xD;
        within the sector, and the accompanying economic and commercial&#xD;
        benefits. Watson and Behan's work on improving the sperm competency of&#xD;
        frozen/ thawed boar semen, through new, and now standard, biological&#xD;
        media formulations, has brought a number of benefits." [b]. This,&#xD;
      together with the team's identification of genetic markers which indicate&#xD;
      the viability of boar sperm for cryopreservation and likely fresh&#xD;
      longevity, has addressed sub-optimal performance of frozen/thawed boar&#xD;
      semen, as well as helping to overcome the short period of usability for&#xD;
      fresh ejaculates, which formerly restricted access to the highest genetic&#xD;
      stock, by reasons of distance and transport logistics.&#xD;
    RVC's research also demonstrated that a significantly smaller sperm&#xD;
      sample may be used for post cervical AI - leveraging gain from high&#xD;
      genetic value boars - with appropriate biological media, without loss of&#xD;
      reproductive success [b]. The expertise of the RVC team was sought by&#xD;
      world leading agricultural breeding business IMV Technologies, leading to&#xD;
      a collaboration including field trials in pigs, using 50% of the&#xD;
      previously accepted industry standard of sperm numbers per insemination,&#xD;
      enabling twice as many inseminations per boar [5].&#xD;
    The new Deepgoldenpig catheter, originally developed in collaboration&#xD;
      with IMV Technologies for use with fresh semen, additionally facilitated&#xD;
      use of reduced sperm concentration to enable a wider application of&#xD;
      cryopreserved semen from superior boars. Field trials for a second new&#xD;
      catheter, Goldengilt, demonstrated that intracervical AI of gilts as well&#xD;
      as sows, with small sperm doses, could be undertaken safely and simply by&#xD;
      stockmen with appropriate training. IMV states that more than 30% of all&#xD;
      pig breeders worldwide now use the company's `gold standard' insemination&#xD;
      solutions [c]. The efficacy of these new catheters, as demonstrated by the&#xD;
      RVC's field trials research, has led to their being supplied through or&#xD;
      copied by many other AI technology companies internationally, including&#xD;
      e.g. Schippers and Innovis [d,e].&#xD;
    Evidence that managing contact between boars and sows prior to breeding&#xD;
      can maximise breeding performance, has established SSM, in a refined form,&#xD;
      as standard practice internationally in commercial pig breeding operations&#xD;
      using AI [f]. This is also confirmed by BPEX: "... [RVC] work played a&#xD;
        key role in understanding the importance of the management of contact&#xD;
        time in providing optimal conditions for insemination ... developing&#xD;
        practices which have now become standard in many commercial breeding&#xD;
        operations." [b].&#xD;
    As pig breeding has become professionalised in recent years, the value of&#xD;
      these developments has contributed to the expansion and economic value of&#xD;
      AI in commercial pig breeding. (Around 20-30% of total global production&#xD;
      before the REF period, to 60-80%+ in 2013).&#xD;
    Human assisted reproduction&#xD;
    In seeking to further minimise the spread of infection, Watson's research&#xD;
      into the transmission of infectious agents by semen during storage in&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen has led to good practice guidelines for aseptic&#xD;
      preparation and well-sealed packaging. The findings have been taken up in&#xD;
      human medical AI to minimise risk of HIV or other viruses contaminating&#xD;
      shared storage of semen samples [g]. The Scientific Director of the Centre&#xD;
      for Reproductive Medicine, University Hospital Coventry, comments: "In&#xD;
        our clinical protocol, we use a purpose designed commercial kit that&#xD;
        includes a disposable spacer device that avoids the tip of the straw&#xD;
        coming into contact with the semen. This spacer is discarded once the&#xD;
        straw is filled. [...] The concept of keeping the semen out of contact&#xD;
        with the tip of the straw for hygiene purposes, as recommended in the&#xD;
        paper [research reference 8], [...] has been adopted into routine&#xD;
        clinical practice." [h]&#xD;
    Conservation&#xD;
    The extensive studies at RVC on sperm cryopreservation have played a&#xD;
      central role in the global development of Genetic Resource Banks (GRBs),&#xD;
      now recognised as one of the most effective means by which threatened&#xD;
      species can be preserved and managed [i]. As the Head of the Centre for&#xD;
      Species Survival at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has&#xD;
      commented: "...the concepts developed and the research conducted at&#xD;
        the RVC are contributing to the acceptance and advancement of GRBs and&#xD;
        cryobiology to benefit managing and conserving endangered species ...&#xD;
        [these tools] are rapidly becoming common to zoo breeding programs&#xD;
        throughout North America and Europe". The RVC's research has&#xD;
      therefore enhanced the success of efforts to maintain and increase&#xD;
      biodiversity of small breeding populations without the costs, risks and&#xD;
      impracticality of live animal transportation. Successful examples recorded&#xD;
      by the Smithsonian include development of protocols to produce offspring&#xD;
      from the AI of frozen sperm from the scimitar-horned oryx and cheetah, and&#xD;
      the preservation of sperm of the black-footed ferret, one of the rarest&#xD;
      mammals in all of North America. The species was thought extinct before&#xD;
      1979, but its rediscovery and an ongoing major captive breeding programme&#xD;
      from 18 animals has enabled re-introduction at 19 sites in the USA, Canada&#xD;
      and Mexico. Ferret offspring have been produced from sperm cryopreserved&#xD;
      for more than two decades [j].The wild population is still endangered, but&#xD;
      is estimated to have expanded since 2008 from 700 to 1,000 [k].&#xD;
    In conclusion, the RVC's research has helped to increase the productivity&#xD;
      of domestic livestock in all developed farming territories, providing real&#xD;
      economic value. This programme of work has additionally contributed to&#xD;
      safeguarding of human health in assisted reproduction and made a critical&#xD;
      contribution to successful captive breeding and maintenance of genetic&#xD;
      biodiversity for wildlife conservation and species survival.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Different aspects of Professor Paul Watson's research on artificial&#xD;
      insemination and semen preservation techniques, have delivered impact in&#xD;
      agricultural, human healthcare and ecological spheres. They have&#xD;
      contributed to commercial breeding practices, particularly in pigs,&#xD;
      providing substantially improved efficiencies and reliability. Research on&#xD;
      reducing transmission of infectious agents by semen during storage in&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen has been applied to human AI, informing and driving&#xD;
      changes in practice to protect against contamination leading to infection.&#xD;
      In the field of conservation, the RVC's research has made a significant&#xD;
      contribution to international efforts directed at the survival of highly&#xD;
      endangered species, supporting preservation of biodiversity.&#xD;

    From before 1993, to his retirement in 2008, Paul Watson, Professor of&#xD;
      Reproductive Cryobiology, and his research team studied aspects of&#xD;
      artificial insemination and in particular, cryopreservation of&#xD;
      spermatozoa. Their work has demonstrated capacitation changes resulting&#xD;
      from freezing damage, resulting in lowered fertility in use of&#xD;
      cryopreserved semen. Through research into cell damage and its prevention,&#xD;
      including the use of oviductal proteins, seminal plasma, antifreeze&#xD;
      proteins and glycoproteins to enhance sperm survival and fertility, the&#xD;
      RVC's research has contributed to new biological media formulations&#xD;
      relating to protection against cooling damage, dilution, premature&#xD;
      capacitation and ice crystal formation [1,2].&#xD;
    The cryopreservation research led to a programme supported by BBSRC and&#xD;
      the commercial PIC International Group, which identified genetic&#xD;
      variability in cryopreserved sperm viability in boars [3]. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the research, in collaboration with Dr William Holt at the Institute of&#xD;
      Zoology, led to their establishment of improved cryopreservation&#xD;
      techniques applicable to different mammalian species. Holt, supported by&#xD;
      Watson, led a European Framework III Concerted Action project in 1994, to&#xD;
      develop formal systems and guidelines for establishing Genetic Resource&#xD;
      Banks (GRBs) [4].&#xD;
    In 2002, RVC published the results of a substantial field trial,&#xD;
      supported by a large pig farm and commercial suppliers of semen for AI and&#xD;
      sows [5]. This demonstrated both that simple, safe and effective&#xD;
      transcervical insemination of sows, rather than the conventional&#xD;
      insemination into the posterior region of the cervix, could be undertaken&#xD;
      by stockmen in a commercial setting, by use of the novel catheter design&#xD;
      (the Deepgoldenpig) developed by IMV Technologies in collaboration with&#xD;
      the RVC researchers, and that fertility was unaffected by a much reduced&#xD;
      sperm dose, if delivered directly to the uterus.&#xD;
    The close involvement of industry partners from different parts of the&#xD;
      production chain (pig farms, boar stud, and reproductive technologies&#xD;
      company) enabled continued research into optimising fertility and&#xD;
      fecundity through management of boar contact [6]. The team showed&#xD;
      `Segregated Service Management' (SSM) - isolating weaned sows from boar&#xD;
      stimulation until day 4 post-weaning, followed by full boar contact to&#xD;
      elicit oestrus before AI, resulted in significantly improved farrowing&#xD;
      rate and litter size, in comparison with conventional continuous contact.&#xD;
    This was followed by research into AI of gilts, which was not as commonly&#xD;
      practised, due to the smaller dimension of the cervix representing a&#xD;
      barrier, and susceptibility to mucosal damage. The research team&#xD;
      demonstrated the practical application, with minimal training, of a novel&#xD;
      modified catheter with a narrow extension (the Goldengilt, now produced by&#xD;
      IMV Technologies). This was used with reduced semen concentration and&#xD;
      still resulted in farrowing and litter sizes comparable to or better than&#xD;
      usually observed commercially by natural service [7].&#xD;
    In 1997, the group identified the potential for transmission of&#xD;
      infectious agents through leakage and contamination of semen stored in&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen [8]. This paper has contributed to good practice&#xD;
      guidelines for human and animal applications.&#xD;

    The work of Ashcroft at Oxford, with Hattersley's team at Exeter, has&#xD;
      transformed therapy for people born with ND. Until 2006, ND patients were&#xD;
      treated with insulin because their clinical characteristics suggested an&#xD;
      unusually early onset form of type 1 diabetes (in which insulin-secreting&#xD;
      beta cells are destroyed and exogenous insulin is essential). As a direct&#xD;
      result of the research described above, the first patient was switched to&#xD;
      oral sulphonylurea treatment in August 2006, and since then at least 500&#xD;
      patients have transferred from insulin injections to the oral drugs, the&#xD;
      bulk of them from 2008 onwards. Clinicians worldwide now routinely screen&#xD;
      infants presenting with ND, as well as adult patients who developed&#xD;
      diabetes at a young age, for KATP channel mutations.&#xD;
    Transfer to oral drugs has not only transformed the quality of life for&#xD;
      those with ND (and that of their families), it has also had marked&#xD;
      clinical benefits. Fluctuations in blood glucose, a common problem in ND&#xD;
      patients, are substantially reduced, and potentially dangerous&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic episodes are less common. Blood glucose control is&#xD;
      substantially improved, lowering the risk of diabetic complications, such&#xD;
      as blindness, kidney disease, heart disease and limb amputations. Such&#xD;
      complications account for the majority of the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      burden of diabetes, so this reduction results in life-time cost savings of&#xD;
      eventual healthcare needs. Furthermore, daily insulin injections are&#xD;
      inconvenient, unpleasant, restrictive in terms of lifestyle, and&#xD;
      relatively expensive. By contrast, sulphonylureas are cheap, off-patent,&#xD;
      drugs that have been in routine clinical use for treating type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      for more than 30 years. In the first study into the use of sulphonylureas&#xD;
      to treat ND, 90% of the trial group successfully discontinued insulin&#xD;
      after receiving sulphonylureas7.&#xD;
    About 20% of ND patients with K ATP channel mutations also have&#xD;
      neurological symptoms8, 9. Some have severe mental and motor&#xD;
      developmental delay and (in approximately 3% of cases) epilepsy in&#xD;
      addition to ND (named DEND syndrome by Ashcroft and Hattersley)8.&#xD;
      Most also have muscle hypotonia accompanied by delayed speech and walking.&#xD;
      These symptoms arise because KATP channels are found in brain&#xD;
      and muscle, as well as in pancreatic beta cells. Sulphonylurea drugs&#xD;
      ameliorate the neurological problems in some of these patients8.&#xD;
      Importantly, some children who were started on sulphonylureas at diagnosis&#xD;
      have not yet developed obvious neurological complications, although it is&#xD;
      too early to be certain if this will be true for all patients.&#xD;
    Since 2008, sulphonylurea therapy has become the therapy of choice for&#xD;
      patients with KATP channel mutations. Guidelines from the&#xD;
      International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes state that ND&#xD;
      patients should be treated with sulphonylurea drugs10. The NHS&#xD;
      has also approved research showing that genetic testing for ND is cost&#xD;
      effective, since transfer to sulphonylurea drugs leads to significant cost&#xD;
      savings in the long term11. Ashcroft and Hattersley have&#xD;
      disseminated the results of their research in seminars, lectures, media&#xD;
      interviews and other venues, which has been vital in reaching the greatest&#xD;
      number of clinicians and new families who might benefit from the drug&#xD;
      treatment; as a direct result there are now clinics worldwide offering&#xD;
      genetic testing for ND.&#xD;
    Ashcroft and Hattersley organised and ran the first `Families Day'&#xD;
      meeting for patients with ND and their families in July 2009 in London.&#xD;
      Several families remain in regular contact with one or both of the Oxford&#xD;
      and Exeter teams. Through such contacts it has become apparent that apart&#xD;
      from the clinical benefits associated with sulphonylurea therapy, the&#xD;
      impact upon an individual's quality of life, and that of their family, has&#xD;
      been considerable. One patient described switching from insulin therapy to&#xD;
      sulphonylureas as `like night and day'12, and another said the&#xD;
      new treatment had `given him his life back'13. Numerous other&#xD;
      patient stories describe ways that sulphonylurea treatment has&#xD;
      revolutionised their lives with diabetes14-16; one mother&#xD;
      reports that thanks to sulphonylurea treatment her daughter `has now been&#xD;
      completely off insulin for seven years with the blood sugar control of a&#xD;
      non-diabetic. A truly life-changing miracle'17. The impact of&#xD;
      this research has resulted from an extremely effective collaborative&#xD;
      interaction between the researchers at Oxford and Exeter, clinicians,&#xD;
      patients, and their families.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Research undertaken by Professor Frances Ashcroft at the University of&#xD;
      Oxford and her collaborators at the University of Exeter has led to&#xD;
      several hundred neonatal diabetes (ND) patients worldwide being able to&#xD;
      switch from daily insulin injections to oral sulphonylurea tablet therapy&#xD;
      since 2008. ND is a rare but potentially devastating monogenic form of&#xD;
      diabetes affecting about 1 in 150,000 live births. Sufferers were&#xD;
      previously assumed to have type 1 diabetes and thus were treated with&#xD;
      insulin injections; sulphonylurea treatment has transformed their quality&#xD;
      of life and led to marked health improvements. It has also ameliorated the&#xD;
      mental and motor developmental delay that affects about a fifth of ND&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      pancreas. They identified the key event in this process: the closure of&#xD;
      ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels by glucose metabolism.&#xD;
      They discovered that the KATP channel functions as a gated pore&#xD;
      and that when the pore is open insulin secretion is inhibited, and when it&#xD;
      is closed insulin release is stimulated.&#xD;
    In 1995, Ashcroft's team cloned and sequenced a key subunit of the&#xD;
      channel (Kir6.2) and showed the channel is made up of pore-forming Kir6.2&#xD;
      and regulatory SUR subunits1. This work was essential&#xD;
      preliminary research that enabled subsequent screening of patients' DNA&#xD;
      for mutations causing insulin secretory disorders. In 1997, the team&#xD;
      showed that ATP (produced by glucose metabolism) binds to Kir6.2 to cause&#xD;
      channel inhibition2 and identified mutations that impair ATP&#xD;
      binding. In 2003, Professor Ashcroft and Dr Declan Doyle (formerly from&#xD;
      the University of Oxford's Department of Biochemistry) determined the&#xD;
      first atomic structure of a Kir channel3. Subsequently,&#xD;
      Professor Ashcroft and Professor Mark Sansom, also from the Department of&#xD;
      Biochemistry, used this structure to produce a molecular model of Kir6.2&#xD;
      that enabled them to identify the ATP-binding site4. This model&#xD;
      explained how Kir6.2 mutations impair channel inhibition by ATP.&#xD;
    In 2004, Professor Andrew Hattersley of the University of Exeter found&#xD;
      the first mutation in Kir6.2 associated with neonatal diabetes (ND) &amp;#8212; a&#xD;
      rare genetic disease that affects about 1 in 150,000 live births&#xD;
      worldwide, and has a serious impact on health and quality of life.&#xD;
      Newborns affected are smaller than those of the same gestational age, due&#xD;
      to lack of insulin (a growth factor) in the womb, and can fail to gain&#xD;
      weight normally. Diabetes develops within the first six months of life and&#xD;
      can be severe; some infants are admitted to hospital with diabetic&#xD;
      ketosis. Ashcroft's team showed that the mutation in ND impairs the&#xD;
      ability of ATP to shut the K ATP channel5 ; because channel closure is&#xD;
      required for insulin secretion, this leads to impaired insulin release and&#xD;
      thus to ND. Professors Ashcroft and Hattersley then suggested that it&#xD;
      should be possible to treat ND patients with oral sulphonylureas (already&#xD;
      in routine clinical use for type 2 diabetes) rather than injections of&#xD;
      insulin. Clinical studies showed that sulphonylureas can indeed be&#xD;
      successfully used to treat the diabetes of patients with this and many&#xD;
      other different KATP channel mutations.&#xD;
    Recently, Ashcroft's team made a mouse model of human ND and used this to&#xD;
      show that the muscle hypotonia and other motor problems of patients with&#xD;
      severe ND mutations originate in the brain, not the muscle. This has&#xD;
      implications for therapy, as drugs must cross the blood-brain barrier6.&#xD;
      Ongoing studies of mice models reveal that sulphonylurea therapy preserves&#xD;
      beta cell function and mass better than insulin, and start to explain some&#xD;
      of the differences in phenotype between ND and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    By the end of the 1990s, the Human Genome Project and associated
      large-scale projects were fuelling the expanding worldwide demand for
      antibodies that recognised relevant target proteins. The development of
      extensive new methodology for the production and characterisation of
      conformationally accurate mammalian proteins, which had evolved during
      work on the role of leukocyte cell membranes in immunity, placed Barclay's
      group in an ideal situation to establish a pipeline for the large-scale
      production of high quality and reliable polyclonal antibodies. This
      commercial opportunity was exploited and has had wide-reaching impacts.
    Professor Neil Barclay and Dr Nick Hutchings, assisted by Mr Ravindra
      Sapkota and Dr Raju Adhikari (Nepalese graduates from the Department of
      Biochemistry at the University of Oxford), developed a business plan to
      produce polyclonal antibodies on a high-throughput basis utilising the
      combination of competitive production facilities and locally-farmed goats
      in Nepal. A Business Angel provided &amp;#163;350,000 and the spin-out company
      Everest Biotech Ltd7 and its Nepalese subsidiary Everest
      Biotech Pvt. Ltd, were successfully launched in 2000. Hutchings became the
      Chief Executive of Everest Biotech Ltd and the Chairman of Everest Biotech
      Pvt. Ltd in 2001. Antibodies went on sale in 2002 through a variety of
      companies including Abcam and Serotec. More than 6,000 products have now
      been produced and marketed with approximately 60 more antibodies being
      produced every month. Everest Biotech Ltd also works in collaboration with
      researchers to produce custom made antibodies for individual research
      projects and more than 200 custom antibodies have been made in this way.
      Importantly, the company also provides technical support to its customers.
      In 2005, Everest Biotech Ltd began selling antibodies under its own brand
      name to customers in the USA, an event that was facilitated by outsourcing
      with LifeScience Logistics8. Sales grew steadily without
      further external investment to reach &amp;#163;0.49M in the year to 31st
      May 20089.
    Since 2008, Everest Biotech Ltd has become an important commercial
      company, not only making a significant contribution to scientific and
      medical communities, but also benefiting the small Nepalese community it
      sustains through agricultural support and employment. The success of
      Everest Biotech also led Barclay and Hutchings to establish the company
      Absolute Antibody in 2012, to provide monoclonal antibodies made by
      recombinant DNA technology to the scientific and medical communities10.
    Commercial engagement
    Everest Biotech Ltd has up to five full-time staff in the UK involved in
      product design and distribution with Hutchings as Chief Executive, and 25
      Nepalese employed full-time in the antibody production facility at Everest
      Biotech Pvt. Ltd. The Nepalese subsidiary has been described as one of the
      ten key institutional stakeholders in the medical biotechnology sector in
      Nepal11. Everest Biotech has been a major supplier to Abcam
      Ltd, one of the most successful UK companies selling antibodies, and
      recently began supplying antibodies to Sigma-Aldrich. Everest Biotech
      antibodies are now distributed throughout the world under the Everest
      brand via companies such as Abcore (USA), Sanbio
      (Netherlands), Funakoshi (Japan) and Sapphire Bioscience (Australia and
      New Zealand)12. This commercial success has also enabled
      Everest Biotech to open a branch in California13.
    Everest Biotech is now a profitable company with approximately 75% of its
      products being exported. Since 2008, over &amp;#163;7.5 million of Everest Biotech
      antibodies have been sold worldwide and turnover in the year to 31 May
      2012 exceeded &amp;#163;1 million9. An important role of Everest Biotech
      Pvt. Ltd is as an export industry, bringing in approximately &amp;#163;250,000 per
      annum to Nepal, an economy that is greatly unbalanced towards the import
      of goods14.
    Community engagement (social, cultural and economic impact)
    As the only biotech company in Nepal providing employment within the
      poorer rural communities, Everest Biotech Pvt. Ltd has had an important
      social and economic impact on the lives of many Nepalese workers and
      farmers. Everest Biotech Ltd uses several hundred goats per year purchased
      from local breeders to make its antibodies. These goats are then
      distributed to approximately 100 individual farmers in the villages around
      Kathmandu who are paid a premium for looking after them, a situation akin
      to the establishment of a large number of small animal facilities. One
      very important aspect of this support has been that owing to the farmers'
      increased income, many children now attend school in these villages rather
      than remain at home to help with farm work. The company also promotes
      animal welfare at the village level by providing veterinary care and
      vaccines for all goats in the community, including those owned by the
      farmers as well as those being used for antibody production14.
    The employment of 25 Nepalese staff at Everest Biotech Pvt. Ltd in
      Kathmandu further promotes the local economy. Many of the staff, after
      obtaining excellent training within an industrial setting, progress on to
      obtain higher qualifications either in Nepal or overseas. Additionally,
      the company provides expertise to the life science community of Nepalese
      universities14. Furthermore, Everest Biotech Ltd is the major
      benefactor to a number of good causes in Nepal such as The Esther
      Benjamins Trust15, which is a UK based charity supporting the
      rescue of trafficked children in Nepal.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Professor Neil Barclay and Dr Nick Hutchings established Everest Biotech
      Ltd in 2000 in response to the increasing demand for high quality
      antibodies within the research community. This successful spin-out company
      has since become a major power in antibody research and production, a
      position reflected by its portfolio of more than 6,000 antibodies
      recognising human, mouse and rat proteins, and the generation of 60 new
      antibodies each month. With offices in the UK and Nepal, Everest Biotech
      Ltd also benefits one of the poorest communities in the world by providing
      additional income to hundreds of farmers in the Nepalese foothills.

    Modern research continues to identify increasing numbers of proteins and
      the ability to study these molecules at the single cell level is crucial
      in order to identify and understand their functional roles. Cell surface
      proteins play important roles in communicating between a cell and its
      environment, and are thus involved in fundamental cellular processes such
      as signalling and molecular recognition. Structural analysis of these
      proteins is complicated because many are embedded in the cell membrane.
      The study of cell surface proteins therefore required the development of
      methods to express soluble forms of the proteins in mammalian cells; these
      soluble forms had to be correctly folded and glycosylated. In 1993,
      Professor Neil Barclay in the MRC Cellular Immunology Unit at the Dunn
      School of Pathology pioneered an approach to achieve this goal whilst
      investigating the biochemical nature of proteins on the cell surface of
      leukocytes and their role in immune regulation1,2. The approach
      was based on the expression of recombinant chimeric proteins that were
      secreted from cells. Because the secreted proteins could be detected with
      antibodies that recognised the known `carrier' portion of the chimera, the
      new technology enabled rapid advances in our understanding of
      receptor-ligand interactions and accelerated the X-ray crystallography of
      immune receptor molecules3.
    The Barclay group subsequently applied proteomics approaches to screen
      all proteins involved in functions on the cell surface, rather than
      concentrating on selected proteins. Using mass spectrometry techniques
      they identified the many proteins involved in transmitting signals from
      the cell surface into the cell. This advance meant that higher-throughput
      technologies were needed for subsequent functional analyses. To this end,
      the group has remained at the forefront of developing assays for studying
      protein interactions, including protein microarrays and high-throughput
      screening for ligands using microarrays4,5.
    In 2000, Barclay realised that, given many of the chimeric proteins were
      also powerful immunogens, this provided the opportunity to generate
      antibodies against large numbers of correctly folded soluble proteins.
      This opportunity was commercialised in the University spin-out company
      Everest Technology. Ongoing research in Oxford supports the company and
      maintains its focus on high quality reagents against proteins that may be
      a focus of future interest. This forward thinking facilitates the fast and
      efficient study of new proteins as and when they are identified. For
      example, Everest's antibodies to FOXP3 protein were available when FOXP3
      became of central importance because of its role in immunoregulation6.

The development of practical PDH laser stabilisation by the University of Glasgow has created&#xD;
global economic impact of many millions of pounds in the period 2008-13. Although the University&#xD;
of Glasgow did not commercialise the PDH technique, the researchers were active in the&#xD;
dissemination of its benefits to audiences both in academia and industry. During the 1990s, the&#xD;
laser and gravitational wave communities shared an interest in stable and rugged high power&#xD;
optics and members of the commercial laser community routinely attended scientific conferences&#xD;
such as the 7th Marcel Grossman Conference (Stanford, 1994) where Ward presented results on&#xD;
the stability of the University of Glasgow 10m interferometer using PDH locking.&#xD;
Moreover, owing to the high profile of the work carried out at Glasgow, the group maintained&#xD;
collaborations with leading universities and research institutes worldwide who in turn also trained&#xD;
students, collaborated with industry and engaged in commercial activities providing an international&#xD;
dimension to the widespread dissemination of the benefits of the PDH technique which ultimately&#xD;
led to industrial adoption. For example, the Glasgow group has an historically close link with Prof.&#xD;
Robert L. Byer at Stanford University and through him to companies adopting PDH in products. For&#xD;
example, New Focus, (subsequently bought by Newport) was a Stanford spin-out which utilised&#xD;
PDH in its products. There were also links between gravitational waves and atom optics groups&#xD;
particularly in Germany and it is from here that companies such as Toptica were founded. Prof.&#xD;
Hough and Prof. Ted Haensch had close links through working on the Scientific and Technical&#xD;
Advisory Committee for the Virgo interferometric gravitational wave detector in 1994-97. Prof.&#xD;
Haensch subsequently founded Menlo Systems in 2001 that produces stable and ultra-stable laser&#xD;
systems.&#xD;
The impact of the University of Glasgow work has occurred on three different scales.&#xD;
a) Sales of dedicated high-speed frequency/phase modulators&#xD;
Implementation of the PHD technique within specialist research establishments and commercial&#xD;
products requires the use of dedicated high-speed frequency/phase modulators that can be&#xD;
inserted into the laser beam and highly stable optical cavities to which the frequency of the laser&#xD;
can be locked.&#xD;
The global number of units sold every year to enable implementation of PDH stabilisation is&#xD;
commercially sensitive but estimates fix revenue at a level of &amp;#163;6-10M per annum. This is broadly&#xD;
similar to revenues generated from sales of complete systems. Companies such as New Focus,&#xD;
Leysop, Thorlabs, and Gsaenger have significant sales due to the widespread adoption of the PDH&#xD;
technique and as confirmed by Newport in 2011, who said: "In particular, Pound Drever Hall (PDH)&#xD;
r-f locking has become the accepted standard technique for locking high finesse resonant optical&#xD;
cavities, and Newport has used it in a range of commercial products. For more than 10 years, New&#xD;
Focus and Newport have sold a large number of r-f electro-optic modulators and high stability&#xD;
cavity mechanics to researchers building PDH systems for laser stabilisation and wavelength&#xD;
conversion."&#xD;
b) Sales of complete laser systems&#xD;
Complete laser systems incorporating PDH stabilisation give turn-key output of laser light with&#xD;
stabilised, and / or predetermined frequency. In addition, the PDH technique is central to enhanced&#xD;
harmonic conversion of laser frequency (e.g. from IR to visible) where the non-linear optical&#xD;
conversion is enhanced within a frequency-matched, resonant cavity.&#xD;
Companies such as Toptica and Sacher Lasertechnik sell green, blue and UV laser systems that&#xD;
depend upon PDH. Newport sells a sub-system that is used with the customer's own laser to&#xD;
produce the required light. Menlo Systems has developed an Optical Reference System based on&#xD;
PDH stabilisation for use in metrology, high precision spectroscopy and interrogation of optical&#xD;
clocks. The reach of this impact is world-wide with the companies above selling into European,&#xD;
North American, Japanese and Asian markets. The market for relevant lasers in such systems is&#xD;
currently worth in excess of &amp;#163;5M per annum, and totalling between &amp;#163;15M and &amp;#163;20M since 2008.&#xD;
One company alone (Toptica) has sales of PDH-enabled frequency-converted systems, with&#xD;
current revenue from the sale of approximately 60 systems per annum being estimated at more&#xD;
than &amp;#163;3M per annum. Their sales are increasing year on year.&#xD;
Moreover quoting from a testimonial from Toptica: "Laser frequency stabilisation to cavities or&#xD;
cavity length stabilisation &amp;#8212; both by the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) method &amp;#8212; are important&#xD;
applications of our customers. Commercial adoption of this method was made practicable after&#xD;
demonstrations in the mid-90's by the Glasgow group and collaborators that reliable, long-term&#xD;
locking of optical systems was possible &amp;#8212; a must for industrial use. Our business benefits from the&#xD;
PDH method in mainly three ways...we developed and sell individual Pound-Drever-Hall detector&#xD;
modules directly to the market... Secondly, these modules are one of the key components of our&#xD;
frequency-converted product family... Thirdly, the PDH method is implemented in our new guide&#xD;
star laser system called SodiumStar20..."&#xD;
Scottish SME M Squared Lasers said: "Although the original publication of the technique was in the&#xD;
1980s, it was only the further work in the early 1990s that Glasgow University clearly showed for&#xD;
the first time that robust and stable operation over long periods of time was possible. This was key&#xD;
in establishing the method as being of real value for use in practical optical applications." Also from&#xD;
M Squared Lasers: "Throughout the period between 1993 and 2013 the work done in Glasgow&#xD;
University on the PDH locking technique had led to a significant portion of the scientific laser&#xD;
companies adopting PDH within their products and this has led to laser manufacturers achieving&#xD;
tens of millions of pounds in product revenue."&#xD;
c) Enabling advanced applications in metrology and the semiconductor industry&#xD;
The commercial availability of PDH stabilised lasers are central to a number of applications beyond&#xD;
research. All of the world's national standards laboratories (e.g. NPL, NIST, BIPM) use PDH&#xD;
stabilised lasers in their time/frequency standards. In addition to these precise absolute optical&#xD;
frequency standard which allow precise distance measurement, PDH is used for precise frequency&#xD;
control with respect to a doubling cavity, allowing laser sources such as the Sony Chicon to&#xD;
generate low noise, continuous wave 266nm light for sophisticated semiconductor inspection tools.&#xD;
The Chicon, emitting deep-UV light at 266 nm with maximum output power of 1W, was originally&#xD;
developed by Sony as a core technology for in-house wafer inspection systems. The main&#xD;
advantage of a short wavelength for wafer-inspection tools is the ability to detect particles as small&#xD;

Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking, developed into a practical technique by researchers at the&#xD;
University of Glasgow, is the ubiquitous method for the precise frequency control of stable laser&#xD;
systems. This control is central to laser products from companies such as Toptica and Newport,&#xD;
and has an estimated global annual market in excess of &amp;#163;5M. The PDH stabilisation technique is&#xD;
essential for the operation of the time standards maintained in all of the world's Governmental&#xD;
Metrological Standards Laboratories (e.g. NPL, NIST, BIPM) and finds applications in inspection&#xD;
tools in the semiconductor industry and deep UV lasers for UV-Raman spectroscopy.&#xD;

All lasers exhibit fluctuations in the frequency of light they emit due to factors such as temperature&#xD;
variations and electronic noise. In many applications, such as metrology, a stable laser is essential.&#xD;
Prior to the developments described here, the use of optical cavities as stable references to which&#xD;
lasers could be locked in frequency, was limited &amp;#8212; both in terms of the spectral purity of the&#xD;
resulting laser light and the duration over which this stability could be maintained. Consequently,&#xD;
until work at the University of Glasgow, the widespread opinion was that optical stabilisation&#xD;
cavities were impractical for commercial use.&#xD;
The first step in the advancement of the field was the development of the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)&#xD;
approach by the University of Glasgow, the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Colorado&#xD;
and Caltech. While the promise of this approach was embodied in the 1983 publication, the&#xD;
technique remained of only academic interest because of the short timescales over which the&#xD;
stability could be demonstrated.&#xD;
The pivotal transformation of PDH arose from innovative research carried out in the mid-late 1990s&#xD;
[1-4] at the University of Glasgow by Professor Jim Hough (Lecturer 1972-83, Senior Lecturer&#xD;
1983-86, Professor 1986-current), Dr Henry (Harry) Ward (Lecturer 1989-95, Senior Lecturer&#xD;
1995-current) and Professor Ken Strain (PPARC Adv. Fellow 1995-99, Lecturer 1999-2003,&#xD;
Professor 2003-present). This research showed for the first time that stable operation over long&#xD;
periods of time was possible. The robustness of PDH as applied to gravitational wave detection&#xD;
established the viability of the method for use in realistic applications. For example, the paper by&#xD;
Robertson, Strain, Hough and Ward et al. [3] reported excellent performance of highly stabilised&#xD;
optical cavities obtained using the PDH technique. Moreover, the group further demonstrated and&#xD;
assessed the robustness and long-term stability of an optical system using multiple instances of&#xD;
this technique [4] and published a demonstration that the technique could be completely&#xD;
automated [1].&#xD;
The demonstration and promotion of this research had two direct consequences. The first was the&#xD;
adoption of the technique as the state-of-the-art (which it remains) in laser research laboratories&#xD;
around the globe. The second was the adoption of this technique by industry, where the key&#xD;
demonstration of its automation and robustness led to the desire to incorporate PDH into&#xD;
commercial products, (particularly in the frequency doubling of light) starting in the late 1990s and&#xD;
continuing today.&#xD;
Although lasers had been widespread since the 1970s, only certain wavelengths were available. In&#xD;
particular, lasers in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum were difficult to obtain. Blue and UV&#xD;
wavelengths required for metrology applications can often only be produced by second harmonic&#xD;
generation by frequency doubling of a visible or near-infra red laser in a non-linear crystal within an&#xD;
optical cavity. To ensure that the frequency doubling works, the laser frequency must exactly&#xD;
match the peak of the cavity resonance and the PDH technique is the best way to achieve this. It&#xD;
was not until the research reported by the University of Glasgow in the mid 1990s that the&#xD;
robustness and long-term stability of this frequency matching was realised.&#xD;
Furthermore, the PDH technique is particularly suited to diode lasers as the frequency modulation&#xD;
used can be directly applied to the drive current of the laser without the need for an external&#xD;
modulator. There are a number of niche markets for these systems where a particular wavelength&#xD;
is required or a continuous wave laser at a short wavelength is necessary.&#xD;

    Since 2008 the research of the Compton group in the field of&#xD;
      heterogeneous reaction mechanisms has had a significant impact at Syngenta&#xD;
      AG, the company with which it has collaborated. Syngenta is the world's&#xD;
      biggest manufacturer of crop chemicals and a major global supplier of&#xD;
      insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. In 2012 it achieved sales of $&#xD;
      14.2 billion [6]; fungicides alone accounted for 23% &amp;#8212; over $ 3 billion &amp;#8212;&#xD;
      of total revenues [7] and insecticides for $ 1.8 billion [8].&#xD;
      Azoxystrobin, sold by Syngenta principally under the trade name Amistar,&#xD;
      is the world's leading fungicide by sales, while thiamethoxam is the&#xD;
      active ingredient developed by Syngenta and used in its product Actara,&#xD;
      the best selling insecticide worldwide. Manufacturing processes for both&#xD;
      these products, as well as others made by Syngenta, have benefited from&#xD;
      important changes as a result of the Compton group research. In the words&#xD;
      of a Senior Fellow at Syngenta UK, "The fundamental science behind the&#xD;
        processes described above has been key to the development of scalable,&#xD;
        robust, optimised manufacturing processes where, although the chemical&#xD;
        fundamentals (rate constant, equilibrium constant, etc.) are scale&#xD;
        insensitive, the mass transfer components are not. The overall thinking&#xD;
        and methodology used is the primary scientific value (transferable to&#xD;
        all and any solid-liquid system, helping to direct technology&#xD;
        exploitation and raising the awareness of the need for such&#xD;
        methodology). However, the specific systems studied have proved of&#xD;
        particular value to Syngenta since 2008 in terms of process changes, and&#xD;
        have helped our process chemists from laboratory synthesis to include&#xD;
        more physical quantitative chemistry in the development process."&#xD;
      [10]&#xD;
    Impact of studies on sparingly soluble inorganic bases in polar&#xD;
        aprotic solvents&#xD;
    Research by the Compton group in this area clearly showed that key&#xD;
      processes, especially at full scale, can be controlled by the physical&#xD;
      process of inorganic base dissolution, and drew attention to the fact that&#xD;
      organic chemistry transformations cannot be studied in isolation from the&#xD;
      inorganic transformations. As such, care needs to be taken when designing,&#xD;
      scaling and running larger scale manufacture of the specific base used,&#xD;
      the physical form of the base used and the processing conditions. This had&#xD;
      substantial impact for Syngenta since 2008. They manufacture Amistar (the&#xD;
      world's largest selling fungicide) via a sequence, the final step of which&#xD;
      employs K2CO3 to deprotonate an acid, HA, in a&#xD;
      polar aprotic solvent, to produce a nucleophilic A-K+ salt.
      This subsequently reacts with an electrophilic chloro-heterocycle to&#xD;
      produce the active ingredient (Ai). The rate limiting `step' in the&#xD;
      overall process can switch from being the covalent-bond-forming reaction&#xD;
      to the rate of carbonate dissolution, depending on the carbonate salt&#xD;
      being used. Understanding this has allowed Syngenta to optimise the&#xD;
      robustness of the process and appreciate fully the potential impact of&#xD;
      using alternative carbonate sources.&#xD;
    The production of Actara, Syngenta's world-leading insecticide, also uses&#xD;
      K2CO3 in the final Ai stage in an analogous manner.&#xD;
      For environmental reasons, Syngenta desired to switch from K2CO3&#xD;
      to Na2CO3, but Na2CO3 failed&#xD;
      in process development with much lower rates, lower conversions, longer&#xD;
      cycle times and increased by-products. Compton's work showed that the&#xD;
      solubility of Na2CO3 and rate of dissolution into&#xD;
      polar aprotic solvents is an order of magnitude less than K2CO3.&#xD;
      With this insight, Syngenta found that the solution-phase reactivity of&#xD;
      the A-K+ and A- Na+ salts were&#xD;
      comparable (slight differentiation due to ion-pairing effects) and that&#xD;
      the failure with Na2CO3 was due to the process being&#xD;
      controlled by the slow rate of dissolution. With this knowledge in hand,&#xD;
      alternative processes were rapidly developed.&#xD;
    In both of these examples, water can be produced. In some cases the&#xD;
      system then switches from involving solid-liquid mass transfer to&#xD;
      solid-liquid-liquid transfer as the water produced becomes saturated in&#xD;
      the inorganic base and phase separates from the polar aprotic solvent.&#xD;
      This produces a gelatinous mass, which at full production scale requires&#xD;
      control of agitation and active removal of the water. Otherwise, again,&#xD;
      the rate of inorganic base mass transfer from the solid phase through the&#xD;
      aqueous liquid phase to the continuous organic solvent (in which the&#xD;
      reactant resides) becomes rate limiting. The methods devised by Compton&#xD;
      have been used by Syngenta to study and control precisely such a process&#xD;
      for an important recently-developed herbicide. A conversion of &amp;gt;98%&#xD;
      without rate-limiting mass transfer is now obtained in manufacture, versus&#xD;
      a previous figure of ~75% [10].&#xD;
    Impact of studies on sparingly soluble organic molecules reacting with&#xD;
        solubilised reactants&#xD;
    Triazine-based herbicides such as Atrazine (used in Syngenta's product&#xD;
      Gesaprim) are crucial to agriculture; it is estimated triazine-based&#xD;
      herbicides currently save US consumers &amp;gt;$ 3 billion p.a. in decreased&#xD;
      producer costs and increased yield and support 85,000 US jobs [9].&#xD;
      Cyanuric chloride forms the basis of triazine-based herbicides, and within&#xD;
      Syngenta the science behind the research of the Compton group has&#xD;
      subsequently been used to optimise the process for manufacture of&#xD;
      herbicides like Gesaprim. Prior to the research of the Compton group, this&#xD;
      had suffered from scale up issues; the work helped identify that the root&#xD;
      cause of the problems was coating of the reactant solid with an even more&#xD;
      insoluble product. [10]&#xD;
    Targeted removal of metal ions from waste streams&#xD;
    Homogeneous Pd catalysis is important in major industrial coupling&#xD;
      reactions. The downside of large scale Pd use beyond the laboratory-scale&#xD;
      is the large amounts of solubilised Pd that have to be recovered and&#xD;
      removed from waste streams &amp;#8212; for both cost and environmental reasons. The&#xD;
      methods and concepts developed by the Compton group have been used by&#xD;
      Syngenta since 2008 to plan how to address the issue and optimise&#xD;
      recovery. [10]&#xD;
    The cost of goods is an especially important issue in the agrochemical&#xD;
      industry [11]. Syngenta are unable to quantify the precise financial&#xD;
      benefits to them of the Compton research concerning individual steps in&#xD;
      multi-stage overall manufacturing processes. However, in the context of&#xD;
      yearly revenues of billions of dollars, the financial impact for the&#xD;
      company is likely to be very substantial. According to the Senior Fellow&#xD;
      at Syngenta UK, "Overall the research of the Compton group has been of&#xD;
        great benefit to Syngenta, enabling significant improvements in the&#xD;
        company's development of processes, and sustainably increasing its&#xD;
        capability in quantitative physical chemistry. The extension of this has&#xD;
        been broad impact into Syngenta's production processes." [10]&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    The cost of goods is an especially important issue in developing&#xD;
      commercially available agrochemicals, which must be manufactured on a&#xD;
      large scale. Richard Compton's research at the University of Oxford has&#xD;
      led to a step change in the understanding of heterogeneous reaction&#xD;
      mechanisms for liquid &amp;#8212; organic solid or liquid &amp;#8212; inorganic solid&#xD;
      processes involved in large-scale manufacturing processes. Compton's work&#xD;
      has had particular impact on optimising the processes used by Syngenta AG&#xD;
      in its manufacturing of agrochemicals. Since 2008 the insights gained on&#xD;
      inorganic-base dissolution have been of great benefit to Syngenta in its&#xD;
      development of scalable robust manufacturing processes, particularly in&#xD;
      relation to production of its fungicide Amistar and insecticide Actara,&#xD;
      which are two of the world's largest selling products of this type. In&#xD;
      2012 Syngenta achieved total sales of over $ 14 billion, $ 4.8 billion of&#xD;
      this from fungicide and insecticide revenues.&#xD;

    Science &amp;amp; methodology&#xD;
      The fundamental science underpinning this case study involves the study of&#xD;
      solid-liquid mass transfer and coupled chemical reactions. The work&#xD;
      described has been carried out since 1993 under the supervision of Richard&#xD;
      Compton at Oxford University. It has involved development of experimental&#xD;
      and modelling methodologies to interrogate and quantify chemical and&#xD;
      physical processes occurring directly at the solid-liquid interface rather&#xD;
      than inferring them from remote indirect methods. Examples of the methods&#xD;
      developed include the channel flow cell with numerous in situ&#xD;
      analysis methodologies (this has been adopted and adapted by others, but&#xD;
      was conceptualised and developed first by Compton), dynamic in situ&#xD;
      AFM [1] and numerous novel electrochemical techniques. Modelling of the&#xD;
      mass transfer processes between detector and solid-liquid interfaces under&#xD;
      controlled and defined fluid-dynamic regimes has enabled direct&#xD;
      measurement of the solid-liquid interfacial processes involved.&#xD;
      Importantly, the new methods enable classes of differentiated mechanisms&#xD;
      to be quantified, varying from those where reaction occurs solely in the&#xD;
      solution phase following dissolution, through processes occurring in the&#xD;
      interfacial regime, to true heterogeneous reactions that occur directly&#xD;
      either at or within the solid surface. The methodology has been applied to&#xD;
      both reactive dissolution processes and precipitation processes. Examples&#xD;
      of particular value to Syngenta include:&#xD;
    (i) Studies on sparingly soluble organic molecules reacting with&#xD;
        solubilised reactants&#xD;
      Cyanuric chloride (CC) is used in the manufacture of dyestuffs and&#xD;
      agrochemicals at the thousands of tonnes per annum scale. CC is sparingly&#xD;
      soluble in water. The Compton group has quantified the reactive&#xD;
      dissolution of CC with amines including competitive hydrolysis [2], which&#xD;
      occurs in parallel with dissolution. Similarly, a mechanistic&#xD;
      understanding of the reaction of the insoluble p-chloranil with&#xD;
      amines has been developed. In this case, the mechanism is further&#xD;
      complicated by formation of a product of even lower solubility which&#xD;
      "coats" the reactant, inhibiting the process [1]. The hydrolysis of&#xD;
      crystalline trityl chloride has also been quantified and shown to be truly&#xD;
      interfacial, driven by the specific orientation and concentration of C-Cl&#xD;
      bonds at the substrate crystal surface; this is an unambiguous example of&#xD;
      how Compton's methodologies can clearly characterise surface reactivity&#xD;
      that is dependent upon the specific crystal face exposed to the reacting&#xD;
      liquid medium [3]. This research was carried out in collaboration with&#xD;
      Zeneca Ltd (who merged into Syngenta AG in 2000).&#xD;
    (ii) Studies on sparingly soluble inorganic bases in polar aprotic&#xD;
        solvents&#xD;
      A significant extension of Compton's work was to refocus the research from&#xD;
      organic to inorganic solids. Inorganic bases such as K2CO3&#xD;
      are used routinely with solvents such as DMF to generate the reactive&#xD;
      anion of an acid in solution for subsequent reaction with a solubilised&#xD;
      electrophile. The research conducted on K2CO3&#xD;
      clearly showed that very low base solubility can, and indeed does, lead to&#xD;
      the dissolution of the base into the solvent becoming rate limiting,&#xD;
      rather than any subsequent chemical step. Establishing this fact has had&#xD;
      significant impact on operation at full scale. Work by Compton (in&#xD;
      collaboration with Syngenta AG) quantified the dissolution rates of&#xD;
      inorganic bases and how they vary depending upon conditions, between&#xD;
      related structures (e.g. K+ vs Na+ base), and the&#xD;
      crystal structure [4]. The methods developed were readily transferable to&#xD;
      Syngenta's processes for agrochemical production (see Section 4) and had a&#xD;
      major impact on their choice of base in manufacturing processes.&#xD;
    (iii) Targeted removal of metal ions from waste streams&#xD;
      Metal catalysed processes, especially using palladium, are becoming&#xD;
      increasingly important in industry. The detection, removal and recovery of&#xD;
      pollution from waste streams is important for cost reasons and to minimise&#xD;
      environmental impact. The Compton group developed methods using simple&#xD;
      functionalisation of cheap carbon to recover precious metals such as&#xD;
      palladium from water, including detailed characterisation of the surface&#xD;
      physical properties that control the removal processes [5].&#xD;

    4a: World distribution and sales
    Over three million dental restorations have been manufactured and placed
      for patients using these highly successful glass-ceramics, generating
      significant industry and general dental practice profits [7]. It is now a
      global product sold in 46 countries including: The Americas (USA,
      Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela); Europe (UK, France, Germany,
      Italy, Belgium, Spain, Russia, Poland, Greece, Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria,
      Cyprus); Asia Pacific (Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
      Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Korea); and Middle East and Africa:
      (Dubai, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Israel, Africa GCC, Turkey). There
      has been an improved public understanding of minimally invasive dentistry
      as these new materials and techniques have been covered extensively in
      newspapers and magazines, including Readers Digest (circulation
      &amp;gt;10m) [8], and on the internet and TV, making these the most
      patient-requested thin veneers in dentistry.
    4b: Industry and academic recognition and clinical trials
    During clinical trials this leucite glass-ceramic was clinically rated
      `excellent' by the Dental Advisor and by the Clinical Research Associates
      (CRA), both of whom are major external assessors who evaluate products for
      the dental profession and consumers. The Leucite glass-ceramic (Lumineers
      2 &amp;#174;) was also awarded top cosmetic product by the Dental Advisor (2009)
      [9]. The research work behind this material also won the Voco prize for
      Dental Biomaterials research at the International Association of Dental
      Research meeting in 2010 [10]. Improved methodology for the measurement of
      tooth wear using white light profilometry was developed during this work
      [11], which has been cited in the literature and is of use in the
      scientific community.
    4c: Change in clinical practice worldwide
    The major impact of this research is that these unique high-strength
      glass-ceramics are used in thinner section (as thin as a contact lens)
      allowing minimal or "no tooth" drilling and eliminating the associated
      pain, discomfort, and local anaesthesia injections (by up to 100%)
      required to prepare teeth (www.lumineers.com/h2_lumineers_why)
      [12]. This also means 100% reduction in postoperative patient pain, less
      tooth destruction (20% less) and fewer or no provisional restorations.
      This equates to 25% more profit for dental practices when placing this
      system (versus traditional materials). High aesthetics combined with a
      pain-free minimally invasive tooth preparation approach [9] has led to
      high patient acceptance and satisfaction with this product (Figure 3).
    This information has been fed back from numerous dental practices
      (&amp;gt;13,000 dentists in the USA use Lumineers) via patient and
      practitioner testimonials [13]. These materials can be easily acid etched
      and adhesively bonded to tooth structure and this has made them
      particularly useful in the treatment of children with microdontia,
      tetracycline staining and amelogenesis imperfecta.
    4d: Patient and dentist testimonials
    A patient said: "The process was amazing &amp;#8212; it was almost too
        easy! No shots, drilling or pain was associated with getting Lumineers.
        I love how natural they look and feel. Who knew getting a new beautiful
        smile could be so easy." [13b]. A dentist said: "Tremendous
        benefits for all our patients because of the no shots or temporaries. It
        produces a tremendous smile with very little or no discomfort to the
        patient." [13b].

    4e: New low-wear materials
    Another major impact of this study was to produce fine and nano-scale
      leucite glass-ceramics with dramatically reduced enamel wear properties.
      Many conventional porcelains/ceramics are destructive to tooth structure
      (four times more abrasive than enamel) and this is increased in patients
      with bruxism. In the UK 8-10% of the population are affected by tooth
      wear. The current materials have the opposite effect and will be kinder to
      tooth structure. We estimate the nano-scale materials give a staggering
      reduction in tooth enamel wear of 43-46% compared to the commercial
      porcelain in our study (6). This is of great benefit to patients to reduce
      tooth destruction, pain and the prevention of more complex dental
      treatment, such as costly bridges and implants when worn teeth are
      difficult to restore. These materials do not have biocompability issues
      and are less cytotoxic than current lithium disilicate ceramics, many
      metals and composites. There is less or no drilling and its associated
      pain for patients, and up to 100% less post-operative pain. The materials
      can also prevent future repeat or more complex dental treatment, hence
      high satisfaction in both adults and children.
    4f: Industry feedback and publications
    The Leucite glass-ceramics developed at Queen Mary were translated into
      two products by a US-based company (Den-Mat Holdings), with two patents
      filed [14, 15], and seven published papers [eg 1-6]. Dr Cattell was
      responsible for translating this lab-based research to industry and
      setting up the processing technology. This led to a heat extruded leucite
      glass-ceramic (Cerinate Pressable) and the Lumineers&amp;#174; 2 glass-ceramic used
      in conjunction with new CAD-CAM and 3D-printing technologies [16]. The
      versatility of these products and the ease of manufacture made them
      desirable to industry and generated significant industry and general
      dental practice income (veneers cost $800-2,000 per tooth in US practice).
      www.lumineers.com/h2_lumineers_cost
    This resulted in hiring of new staff (increased employment in California)
      at the US-based dental company and investment in new technology [17]. A
      recent company consumer assessment of online conversation related to
      branded dental veneers indicated the dominance of Lumineers over two of
      their primary competitors (Figure 4).

    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Novel low-wear, high-strength glass-ceramics were developed at Queen Mary
      in 2000-2011 by Dr Cattell's team to prevent facture and wear of dental
      ceramic restorations. Over three million restorations have been provided
      for patients and sold in 46 countries. The product has won industry awards
      for clinical and cosmetic excellence from the Clinical Research Associates
      and Dental Advisor, who externally assess products for consumers. The
      product uses a 100% pain-free minimally invasive approach, saving as much
      as 20% enamel reduction per patient, as tooth preparation and anaesthesia
      are not required. We also estimate a substantial reduction in tooth enamel
      wear of 43-46% for this nano-scale product compared to commercial
      porcelain. It has high patient acceptance and satisfaction, and has
      received media coverage worldwide.

    Novel high strength, low wear leucite glass-ceramics

    Dr Cattell, Senior Lecturer in Dental Technology, undertook this research
      (2000-2011) with his team at Queen Mary to address problems encountered in
      clinical dentistry, particularly in general practice, with brittle
      fracture of porcelain restorations and their poor survival rates over ten
      years (crowns = 52% and veneers = 47%) and substantial costs (&amp;#163;117.5M and
      &amp;#163;6.5M respectively). The team also considered problems of tooth wear
      against current abrasive porcelains, as 14% of people in the UK suffer
      from bruxism (teeth grinding). The objectives were to produce low-wear and
      high-strength aesthetic glass-ceramics to resolve these problems and
      reduce patient pain.
    Fundamental work
    Dr Cattell conducted the fundamental work on leucite glass-ceramics
      (2000-2004) that led to the Cerinate heat extruded commercial product.
      Processing of these leucite glass-ceramics using heat extrusion to produce
      dental restorations led to an even distribution of fine crystallites and
      increases in tested reliability (m = 9.4, m = Weibull Modulus) and
      flexural strength (159.1 MPa) compared with current materials (120.1 MPa,
      m = 6.1) [1]. During this work he discovered a process of controlling the
      leucite crystal size in a thermally compatible glass [2]. His team
      discovered that control of the chemistry and physical properties of the
      glass, together with crystallite size, were key to enhancing the
      properties of the glass-ceramic. They also demonstrated efficient adhesive
      bonding of these materials and further surface strengthening (200.2 MPa)
      [3].
    Discovery of high-strength / low-wear leucite glass-ceramics
    Dr Cattell's team (2005-2011) worked with Professor Hill on the original
      glass formulation together with a range of new glasses. These glasses were
      designed using Appen factors so properties like refractive index, thermal
      expansion and fusion temperature could be predicted before the glasses
      were made. Tailoring these properties to that of the leucite crystal phase
      allowed the production of transparent and highly aesthetic materials, with
      residual strains between the crystal and glass matrix matched to encourage
      increases in mechanical properties. Controlled fusion temperature also
      allowed the fabrication of dental restorations at temperatures suitable
      for manufacturing.
    The team also focussed on the fundamental aspects of nucleation and
      crystal growth of leucite glass-ceramics and powder processing to control
      surface crystallisation and produce fine [4] and, later, nano-scale
      leucite glass-ceramics. These studies were critical to reducing the size
      of the abrasive leucite crystals that had enormous benefits in terms of
      reduced enamel wear, improved aesthetics and increased strength. Leucite
      glass-ceramics were produced with significantly higher flexural strength
      (&amp;gt;250 MPa, Figure 1) and reliability (m=11.9) when compared to a
      European market leader [5]. Research ethics approval was gained to test
      the wear of these new materials against human enamel (REC: 06/Q0603/98).
      The outcome was significantly lower enamel wear compared with a commercial
      market leader [6] (Figure 2).
    New technologies
    The group also demonstrated these materials could be processed using heat
      extrusion and newer CAD-CAM and 3D-printing technologies to produce dental
      restorations. This material was adopted as an aesthetic restorative
      material for clinical use (Lumineers&amp;#174; 2, Den-Mat Holdings,
      USA), and used in the fabrication of over three million dental
      restorations. These stronger materials are used in thin section
      encouraging minimally invasive adhesive dentistry. The outcomes are less
      drilling and pain for patients and prevention of crown fracture and
      destructive enamel wear.

    Cranfield's research into materials degradation in industrial gas&#xD;
      turbines has influenced materials selection, the standardisation of test&#xD;
      methods, new coating systems and systems and fuel specification in power&#xD;
      generation.&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Materials selection and component life assessment&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Siemens, Rolls Royce and others have used our methods for selection of&#xD;
      improved materials systems for particular applications [C2, C4, C5, C8,&#xD;
      C10]. The selection of the best materials systems (coatings and base&#xD;
      alloys) for components in jet engines and gas turbines improves their&#xD;
      potential lives [C1, C6, C7]. High temperature oxidation and the various&#xD;
      types of hot corrosion are critical issues for many components in turbine&#xD;
      power systems e.g. blades, vanes, discs, and seals. In well-designed&#xD;
      components, or with particular fuels/operating conditions, such&#xD;
      degradation modes can limit component life. The damage can affect times&#xD;
      between overhauls and risk of component failure.&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Test method standardisation&#xD;
    &#xD;
    The deposit recoat test methodology for assessing corrosion in gas&#xD;
      turbines developed at Cranfield was incorporated into an EU code of&#xD;
      practice, and has become one of the recognised routes for assessing high&#xD;
      temperature corrosion (draft ISO/CD 17224). This is one of the first ISO&#xD;
      standards for high temperature corrosion and oxidation. Our dimensional&#xD;
      metrology processes and methods for data analysis form parts of two other&#xD;
      ISO standards issued in 2012 (BS ISO 26146:2012 and BS ISO 14802:2012,&#xD;
      respectively. Rolls Royce and Siemens have adopted the methods as their&#xD;
      standard approaches to assessing the performance of metallic gas turbine&#xD;
      materials for these forms of damage. The consequence has been increased&#xD;
      confidence in materials selection to resist degradation by hot corrosion&#xD;
      [C8, 10].&#xD;
    &#xD;
      New coating systems&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Novel coating systems were developed for different specific environments,&#xD;
      focused on meeting the needs of Rolls Royce [C6-8] and Siemens Industrial&#xD;
      Turbo-machinery [C9, 10]. The work is of particular interest to jet engine&#xD;
      and industrial gas turbine manufacturers, who need coatings that can be&#xD;
      operated for longer and in more arduous conditions. Such developments&#xD;
      involve increasingly complex coating systems applied in multiple stages,&#xD;
      but are commercially sensitive [C6, 7]. Functionally graded coatings that&#xD;
      are highly resistant to hot corrosion and oxidation were produced with&#xD;
      Siemens and Praxair (Siemens was granted a patent with Cranfield&#xD;
      co-authors) [C9, 10].&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Advanced power generation systems and fuel specification&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Guidance is being provided for the development of overall power system&#xD;
      concepts to optimise the balance between gas turbine operating conditions,&#xD;
      gas cleaning system requirements, fuel specifications and component lives.&#xD;
      The advanced fossil fuel/biomass fired power systems that are under&#xD;
      development (e.g., using gasification technologies) need to push the&#xD;
      boundaries of materials performance in many respects with degradation due&#xD;
      to creep, fatigue and corrosion/oxidation limiting both component lives&#xD;
      and plant operating efficiencies. An example is a UK-US programme on&#xD;
      quantifying the relationships between contaminant levels and materials&#xD;
      damage from hot corrosion, with Siemens [C1 &amp;#8212; C5]. These activities have&#xD;
      identified materials systems to be used for gas turbine blades/vanes (and&#xD;
      materials systems to be avoided) for viable component lives.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    This research enables longer component lives for industrial gas turbines&#xD;
      and jet engines, and development of new protective coating systems.&#xD;
      Siemens and Rolls Royce have improved their selection of materials systems&#xD;
      used in components in the hot gas paths e.g. blades, vanes, discs, and&#xD;
      seals. Degradation mechanisms in operating turbines, or anticipated in&#xD;
      future materials systems, limit the lives of these components and the&#xD;
      efficiencies of systems. New functionally graded coatings were created&#xD;
      that are highly resistant to hot corrosion and oxidation. Methodology has&#xD;
      been adopted in ISO standards BS ISO 26146:2012, BS ISO 14802:2012 and&#xD;
      ISO/CD 17224.&#xD;

    Cranfield has investigated environmentally induced degradation (forms of&#xD;
      hot corrosion and oxidation) for various materials systems (base alloys&#xD;
      and metallic coatings) used in components (e.g., blades, vanes, discs and&#xD;
      seals) of industrial gas turbines and jet engines. The drivers have been&#xD;
      the need to improve efficiencies, reducing CO2 emissions and&#xD;
      fuel use; to allow the use of new fuel sources; and to improve reliability&#xD;
      by maintaining, or improving, component lives whilst using higher&#xD;
      operating temperatures and fuels with higher levels of contaminants.&#xD;
    This work has been aimed at improving the understanding of hot corrosion&#xD;
      (high and low temperature) and oxidation in these systems [G2, 3, 5; P1-3,&#xD;
      5, 6]. Cranfield has investigated the relationships between the damage&#xD;
      observed in different materials systems and the contaminants in the hot&#xD;
      gas stream (from different sources and qualities of fuel and air), gas&#xD;
      temperatures and pressures, component surface temperatures and deposits&#xD;
      formed on surfaces.&#xD;
    We optimised a methodology for assessing hot corrosion damage of&#xD;
      materials [G2, 3, 5; P2, 6]. This involves the use of deposit re-coat&#xD;
      testing combined with exposure in controlled-atmosphere furnaces. Samples&#xD;
      are measured before and after exposure to quantify the distribution of&#xD;
      damage in a statistically reliable method. One benefit of this method is&#xD;
      it allows the effects of specific aspects of the exposure to be&#xD;
      quantitatively linked to the materials damage found [P2, 6]. This enables&#xD;
      the sensitivity of materials to changes in exposure conditions to be&#xD;
      determined, and compared to the conditions/damage seen in operating&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
    A further investigation explored the ability of alternative metallic&#xD;
      coating compositions to resist particular degradation modes [G1, 4; P4].&#xD;
      This covered new developments for Al-Si diffusion coatings and MCrAlY&#xD;
      sprayed coatings. In addition, research on protective coatings examined a&#xD;
      new class of functionally graded metallic coatings that can resist&#xD;
      multiple degradation modes [G4].&#xD;
    A third strand investigated the performance of existing and developmental&#xD;
      metallic coatings/alloys in industrial gas turbines, in future power&#xD;
      generation systems [G2, 5], [P1, 3, 5]. The need for new materials and&#xD;
      changes to more realistic system configurations has been identified. For&#xD;
      example, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems that use&#xD;
      biomass/coal derived syngases (i.e., synthetic fuel gases), or hydrogen&#xD;
      enriched syngases (e.g., for EU H2-IGCC project), to fire gas turbines,&#xD;
      and gas turbines using oxy-fired natural gas (e.g., natural gas fired zero&#xD;
      emission power plant, GAS-ZEP). Assessment of the exposure environments&#xD;
      and operating conditions for components in these new power systems have&#xD;
      been used as a basis for the experimental work. These activities have&#xD;
      guided the development of power system concepts to optimise the balance&#xD;
      between gas turbine operating conditions, gas cleaning system&#xD;
      requirements, fuel specifications and component lives.&#xD;

    The American Dental Association estimates that there are around 300&#xD;
      million periodontal examinations undertaken in the USA every year,&#xD;
      representing ca. 30% of the examinations undertaken world-wide. Based on&#xD;
      Watkinson and Krause's research, QMUL's spin-out company Degrasense&#xD;
      (established in January 2008) has developed a system with the likely&#xD;
      capability to accurately identify periods of active inflammation in&#xD;
      relation to periodontal disease that is inexpensive to mass produce. The&#xD;
      meter (Figure 1) is a point of care system that is designed to allow&#xD;
      rapid, in-house diagnosis of periodontal disease, precluding the need to&#xD;
      outsource assays to external laboratories. It has been estimated that the&#xD;
      consumables associated with this novel technology, will have a market&#xD;
      value of approximately 450m GBP per annum (Oraldent &amp;#8212; see below). The&#xD;
      technology will improve the targeting of treatment to patients with active&#xD;
      periodontitis and ultimately improve clinical outcomes and enhance patient&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
    The device developed by spin-out company Degrasense is shown in Figure 1.&#xD;
      Briefly, the meter works by samples of gingival crevicular fluid (GVC)&#xD;
      from the gums, being loaded onto the capillary sensor chip, which contains&#xD;
      electrodes coated with the QMUL patented technology. This sensor is then&#xD;
      loaded into the machine, where protelytic activity of the clinically&#xD;
      relevant proteases in the GVC is measured through changes in electrical&#xD;
      impedance.&#xD;

    &#xD;
    Companies and charities influenced by the research&#xD;
    To reach the point of a clinical trial [below, and 1 in section 5]&#xD;
      required collaboration with a number of industrial partners. Supported by&#xD;
      Technology Strategy Board funding, Watkinson coordinated the industrial&#xD;
      partners to develop the technology specifically for the clinical&#xD;
      diagnostics market. These partners are:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Oraldent (Oraldent: www.oraldent.co.uk)&#xD;
        who assessed the size of the potential periodontal market to be 450m GBP&#xD;
        per annum in consumables (value of disposable capillary sensor chip).&#xD;
      Industrial Design consultancy (IDC: www.idc.uk.com)&#xD;
        [2 in section 5] who designed the meter (see Figure 1)&#xD;
      AND Technology Research (AND: http://andtr.com)&#xD;
        who developed the electronics in the meter [3 in section 5].&#xD;
      Gwent Electronic Materials Ltd. (www.gwent.org/gem_index.html)&#xD;
        who manufactured the interdigitated electrodes used in the clinical&#xD;
        trial [4 in section 5].&#xD;
      Barts Charity (www.bartscharity.org.uk)&#xD;
        who are currently funding Gwent Electronic Materials to further refine&#xD;
        the electrodes based on insights gained through the clinical trial.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Collectively, these industrial partners contributed over &amp;#163;340k to the&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
    Development of a new clinical diagnostic tool and its application&#xD;
          in a clinical trial&#xD;
    The efficacy of the Degrasense technology is currently being assessed via&#xD;
      a clinical trial involving 30 patients suffering from chronic&#xD;
      periodonitis. This is an important step on the road to delivery of this&#xD;
      diagnostic technology to market. The clinical trials are being undertaken&#xD;
      by staff within the School of Clinical Dentistry at the University of&#xD;
      Sheffield, in partnership with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust. The aim of the trial is to assess whether the device can be used to&#xD;
      detect active periodontal disease.&#xD;
    The initial 12-month stage of the trial necessitated the appointment of a&#xD;
      dental hygienist to collect patient samples. The patients were recruited&#xD;
      from a number of sources within the partnering hospital, including the&#xD;
      undergraduate periodontology teaching clinic, staff hygienist clinics and&#xD;
      consultant clinics. All patients were selected by the clinician in charge&#xD;
      [1 in section 5] according to criteria that include; aged 18 or over; a&#xD;
      diagnosis of chronic periodontitis but otherwise healthy and; one healthy&#xD;
      gingival crevice, one deep bleeding and one deep non-bleeding periodontal&#xD;
      pocket.&#xD;
    Data from the first 12 months of the trial have revealed that the&#xD;
      interdigitated electrodes produced by Gwent Electronics need further&#xD;
      refinement. The company, funded by Barts Charity, are currently modifying&#xD;
      the electrodes to increase reliability. All patient samples from the first&#xD;
      stage of the trial have been retained for re-testing once these&#xD;
      refinements are in place.&#xD;
    Application of Degrasense technology in other clinical settings&#xD;
    Krause and Watkinson's technology has already attracted significant&#xD;
      interest and investment from multiple industrial partners and its use in a&#xD;
      clinical setting has been demonstrated through application in a clinical&#xD;
      trial. In addition to increasing the efficacy of diagnostic tools for&#xD;
      assessing periodontal disease, the technology has significant potential in&#xD;
      a number of other clinical applications where elevated levels of&#xD;
      proteolytic enzymes are linked to disease states. Investigations into&#xD;
      these applications are ongoing (and are sensitive at this stage) but&#xD;
      include: (i) home monitoring of haemophilia; (ii) clinical monitoring of&#xD;
      sepsis and trauma; (iii) home monitoring of multiple sclerosis and (iv)&#xD;
      the monitoring of arterial ageing and the role of proteinases in&#xD;
      hypertension. All of these areas are associated with very significant&#xD;
      patient numbers and cost to the NHS. The generic technology that Watkinson&#xD;
      and Krause have developed is capable of providing significant improvements&#xD;
      in the quality of patient monitoring and consequently also reduction in&#xD;
      treatment costs.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    The spin-out company, Degrasense, has developed and protected&#xD;
      intellectual property of technology capable of quantifying specific&#xD;
      proteolytic enzymes through changes in electrochemical responses&#xD;
      (impedance) at electrodes due to the enzymatic degradation of polymer&#xD;
      coatings. The company has detected several specific proteases that are&#xD;
      relevant to the monitoring and treatment of a number of conditions&#xD;
      including: periodontal disease, multiple sclerosis, haemophilia and&#xD;
      hypertension. The technology is currently being validated in a clinical&#xD;
      trial as a point of care sensor for the detection of active periodontal&#xD;
      disease. Point-of-care sensors provide immediate, low-cost test results in&#xD;
      non-laboratory settings, offering a more patient-centred approach to&#xD;
      healthcare and earlier detection of disease.&#xD;

    Staff leading the underpinning research&#xD;
    Dr Steffi Krause (School of Engineering and Materials Science) and&#xD;
      Professor Michael Watkinson (School of Biological and Chemical Sciences)&#xD;
      have been collaborating since 2006 on the development of new, generic, low&#xD;
      cost and non-invasive sensor arrays for the specific detection and&#xD;
      quantitation of a number of proteolytic enzymes, which are clinically&#xD;
      relevant markers for a number of disease states. They have established the&#xD;
      spin-out company Degrasense, which owns the underpinning intellectual&#xD;
      property and are developing the technology via clinical trials.&#xD;
    Other notable QMUL researchers working with Watkinson and Krause include&#xD;
      Dr Jacqueline Stair (BBSRC-funded PDRA, 2008-2009), Dr Xingewi Zheng&#xD;
      (IP2IPO Ltd-funded PDRA, 2008-2010) and Dr Joseph Cook (Technology&#xD;
      Strategy Board-funded PDRA, 2008-2009).&#xD;
    Research underpinning the new technology&#xD;
    The technology is based on the preparation of hydrogel polymers that are&#xD;
      cross-linked with short peptide sequences containing amino acid sequences&#xD;
      cleaved by the specific proteolytic enzymes being targeted [references&#xD;
      1-4].&#xD;
    Through BBSRC-funded research, Krause, Watkinson and Stair developed new&#xD;
      peptide cross- linked dextran hydrogels, which, they demonstrated using a&#xD;
      quartz crystal micro-balance, can sense protease cleavage [see publication&#xD;
      1]. The underpinning work involved the preparation of suitably&#xD;
      functionalised peptides, which could be used to cross-link dextran to form&#xD;
      degradable hydrogel polymers. The key synthetic challenges were to&#xD;
      identify both the functional group which could be cross-linked and the&#xD;
      nature of the polymeric matrix which would allow degradation by the&#xD;
      individual protease in question, at clinically relevant concentrations and&#xD;
      within a short time-frame, without non-specific protein binding. Several&#xD;
      approaches were investigated including the in situ radical&#xD;
      polymerisation of peptides and the cross-linking of highly functionalised&#xD;
      dendronised polymers. Ultimately it was found that a partially oxidised&#xD;
      dextran in combination with amine-functionalised peptides provided&#xD;
      suitable substrates which met the technical specification required.&#xD;
      Consequently they were able to coat individual electrodes with different&#xD;
      polymers so that each electrode is able to detect a specific enzyme. This&#xD;
      aspect of the research is central to the technology &amp;#8212; without it no point&#xD;
      of care device could have been produced.&#xD;
    In a second publication [2], Watkinson, Krause, Zheng and Cook&#xD;
      demonstrated the efficacy of this technology in the selective detection of&#xD;
      a number of proteases (Human Neutrophil Elastase, Cathepsin-G, and MMP8)&#xD;
      that are clinically relevant to periodontal disease. Periodontal disease&#xD;
      (periodontitis) is an inflammatory disease that affects the periodontum,&#xD;
      the tissues that surround and support the teeth. If left untreated,&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis leads to degradation of bone and ultimately to the&#xD;
      loss of teeth. However, progression of the disease is not uniform across&#xD;
      infected sites and accurate clinical methods for distinguishing areas&#xD;
      where the disease is active, rather than inert, are currently lacking. As&#xD;
      a result much unnecessary treatment of periodontal sites that are&#xD;
      quiescent occurs. This is both costly and potentially causes additional&#xD;
      damage to teeth attachments.&#xD;
    The research, led by Krause and Watkinson [1, 2], clearly established the&#xD;
      potential for a new technology, as a point-of-care clinical diagnostic&#xD;
      tool of protease activity associated with periodontal disease. The&#xD;
      intellectual property underpinning the technology was protected by a&#xD;
      European patent [3] and a further patent application has been filed [4].&#xD;
    The potential of this technology led to follow-on funding secured from&#xD;
      the BBSRC and the Heptagon fund in 2006. Then with support from the&#xD;
      Technology Strategy Board, and in collaboration with a number of key&#xD;
      industrial partners, Watkinson and Krause were able to develop the&#xD;
      technology to the point where it could be tested in a clinical trial. They&#xD;
      have also secured Venture Capital (VC) funding and, most recently, funding&#xD;
      from the Barts and the London Charity.&#xD;

    The original Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer (IGA) is manufactured by HIDEN Isochema, a
      world leader in the design and manufacture of gas and vapor sorption
      instrumentation for
      research, development and production applications in surface chemistry and
      materials science.
      The IGA instrumentation suite has achieved a leading position worldwide in
      this field with a
      turnover exceeding &amp;#163;3Mpa. Ross et al's continuing collaboration with HIDEN
      Isochema has
      made a major contribution to the present commercial significance of the
      technique in a range
      of sectors:
    
      
Context: The IGA series is now widely recognised as the most
        accurate analytical tool
        available for the characterisation of a range of different hydrogen
        storage materials and
        Ross et al have developed three IGA instruments in their lab with
        different characteristics
        which have been used to develop new applications. 5 Salford Ph.Ds have
        also continued
        their research as scientific developers at HIDEN.
      Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)
        removal, coal
        research, clean energy technology and the interaction of water with
        natural materials are all
        examples of the application of sorption instrumentation. Both the IGA
        and IGAsorp series
        are used widely in environmental vapor sorption research and in the
        pharmaceutical
        industry, while the IGA and IMI series offer higher pressure gas
        sorption capability for
        applications that require the determination of the uptake of gases such
        carbon dioxide and
        methane at elevated pressures (Carbon Storage and Capture). Research on
        the absorption
        of deuterated toluene in carbons [7] and more recently in
        reactor graphites [8] using
        contrast matching establishes which pores are open to the liquid and
        energy researchers
        using IGA technology include those in the oil and gas industry, and
        those developing
        membranes for fuel cell applications.
      
2008-onwards: Ross et al used the IGA to measure the diffusion
        of hydrogen in metals,
        specifically, in palladium silver alloys foils, where knowledge of the
        behaviour of hydrogen
        isotopes is essential for hydrogen isotope separation in fusion
        applications.
      Cycling metal hydrogen systems using IGA led to the development of in
        situ cycling
        experiments on neutron diffractometers which has been widely adopted in
        practice,
        demonstrating the capacity to change the hydrogen content in situ by
        changing hydrogen
        pressures and temperatures. A derivative of the IGA instrument was
        installed on neutron
        scattering equipment at ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratories for this
        purpose.
      Neutron inelastic scattering from hydrogen compounds adsorbed by
        catalysts on carbon
        substrates has proved a powerful way of identifying molecules on
        surfaces in low
        concentrations, demonstrating applications in a range of industrial
        processes in
        collaboration with Dr Peter Albers, of Degussa AQura [b]. This
        work on the development ofcommercial catalyst systems leading to the
        good carbonaceous catalyst support for fuel
        cell applications was important. Additionally, the method was deployed
        in the development
        of processes for regeneration of the catalyst used in the production of
        hydrogen peroxide.
        2005-2009: The HYTRAIN (Hydrogen storage research training
        network) project had the
        primary aim of training researchers in the area of hydrogen storage in
        solid media with 12
        researchers trained and most now employed in research and development in
        the hydrogen/
        renewable energy field.
      
2006-2010: The NESSHy (Novel efficient solid storage for
        Hydrogen) EC Framework
        project tackled a wide range of possible materials for hydrogen storage.
        Morrison was
        responsible for ab initio modelling and Ross was responsible for
        characterisation. The
        project, which included the materials produced being tested by Daimler
        Chrysler,
        demonstrated the use of combinatorial thin film technique in the
        Mg-Ni-Ti system. The
        research identified a favourable composition for hydrogen storage
        applications.
      
2007-2010: Small Angle Neutron Scattering studies of porosity
        in activated carbons for use
        as hydrogen absorbers led to collaboration with Chemviron Carbon Ltd
        focused on the use
        of small angle neutron scattering with contrast matching and variable
        adsorbate partial
        pressures in the study of porosity in activated carbons: "The
          project involved successful
          industry-academia collaboration with partners Chemviron Carbon, and
          has led to over
          &amp;#163;1.1m follow on funding to develop this and related technology." [c]

2010-present: SANS measurements on reactor graphites
        have yielded important
        measurements of fractal porosity highly relevant to improved
        understanding of AGR
        graphite lifetime. http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/science/energy/isis-research-into-nuclear-graphite-could-keep-the-uks-lights-on14466.html

      
2011: Our work on hydrogen storage and the development of
        demonstration equipment for
        this purpose has led to a considerable amount of outreach activity to
        schools. Additionally,
        funding of &amp;#163;30,000 was awarded to work in partnership with the Museum of
        Science and
        Industry, local schools and Manchester Science Festival, of which the
        University is a
        sponsor, to engage young people, their families and carers with science
        and making
        research accessible to non-experts. [9]

        time of the research
        are as follows: Professor Keith Ross, Professor of Physics (from

    Context: Materials characterisation and modelling researchers have
      been active in the area of
      gas sorption in solid media for over 30 years. Research focused recently
      on lightweight
      hydrogen stores, adopting a combination of experimental techniques
      (sorption measurements
      and neutron scattering) with theoretical 'ab initio' modelling to allow
      insight into the properties
      of hydrogen storage materials. The gravimetric technique for measuring
      gas-solid interactions,
      the Intelligent Gravimetric Analyser (IGA) method, an instrument that is
      now used
      internationally for assessing the gas storage performance of solids, was
      developed by Prof.
      Ross and Dr Benham in 1989 at the University of Birmingham and the IPR was
      transferred to
      HIDEN Isochema in
      1991. Dr Benham moved to the company to exploit the IPR (now MD of
      the IsoChema subsidiary, in charge of marketing the IGA and related
      products), leading to a
      series of collaborative research projects with Ross et al at the
      University of Salford where
      research has focused on the use of gravimetric studies of the
      thermodynamics/ kinetics of the
      hydrogen absorption/ desorption process and the parallel use of a number
      of neutron
      scattering techniques. The impact of this case study is underpinned by the
      following research:
    
      
1998-2003: Ross et al were the first to demonstrate that the
        Intelligent Gravimetric
        Analyzer (IGA) could be used to measure the diffusion of hydrogen in
        metals - specifically
        palladium-silver alloys foils [1]. Subsequent work on cycling
        metal hydrogen systems using
        IGA led to the development of in situ cycling experiments in neutron
        diffractometers [2], a
        technique that has been widely adopted in practice.
      Surface coating techniques for reduction of H/D/T permeation through
        structural metals
        were first developed in connection with the design of the Next European
        Torus. The critical
        research concerned the sputtering of alumina on MANET [3] using
        a novel unbalanced
        magnetron sputtering technique developed at Salford [4]. These
        techniques for reducing
        H/D/T permeation reduced this quantity by ~4 orders of magnitude over a
        wide range of
        temperatures.
      Ab-initio calculations of the potential energy surface seen by
        hydrogen in palladium single
        crystals has yielded values for the energies of (non-harmonic) excited
        quantum states of
        the proton and deuteron, and these results have been confirmed by
        inelastic neutron
        scattering measurements [5]. This work provides a `first
        principles' approach to the
        calculation of the chemical potential of H and D in palladium, allowing
        a prediction of the
        H/D and D/T separation factors, important for isotope separation in
        fusion energy
        development.
      
2004: Neutron inelastic scattering from hydrogen compounds
        adsorbed by catalysts on
        carbon substrates has proved a powerful way of identifying molecules on
        surfaces in low
        concentrations. This work is described in a research undertaken with Dr
        Peter Albers, of
        Degussa AQura [6] and demonstrates applications in a range of
        industrial processes.
      
2005-2008: The HYTRAIN (Hydrogen storage research training
        network) project had the
        primary aim of training researchers in the area of hydrogen storage in
        solid media [14].
      
2006-2010: The NESSHy (Novel efficient solid storage for
        Hydrogen) EC Framework
        project demonstrated the use of combinatorial thin film technique in the
        Mg-Ni-Ti system.
        The research identified a favourable composition for hydrogen storage
        applications. Using
        Pd as a model system, the research found that thin films reproduce the
        thermodynamic
        parameters of bulk in desorption and a range of applications for
        hydrogenography [15].
      
2010-onwards: Collaborations on practical methods for hydrogen
        storage with industrial
        partners involved car manufacturers eg., Daimler Chrysler, materials
        manufacturers such
        as Johnson-Matthey and other major companies in the Hydrogen-Fuel Cell
        field.
      
2010-onwards. Small Angle Neutron Scattering studies of
        porosity in activated carbons for
        use as hydrogen absorbers led to collaboration with Chemviron Carbon
        Ltd., focused on
        the use of small angle neutron scattering with contrast matching and
        variable adsorbate
        partial pressures in the study of porosity in activated carbons [7].
        The development of the
        SANS/contrast matching technique was then applied to studies of neutron
        irradiation
        damage of reactor graphite, important in extending the lifetime of AGR
        reactors [8].

    The ability to monitor and optimise the operation of lasers simply and&#xD;
      reliably is important in many sectors and for some problems it is&#xD;
      essential to know the temporal shape of the pulse. Walmsley and his group&#xD;
      knew that a new device would have commercial appeal if they could reduce&#xD;
      its size so it became smaller than the laser itself, and simple and&#xD;
      reliable enough to be used by non-specialists. This demanded a simplified&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
    The research at Oxford resulted in a number of commercial advantages of&#xD;
      this technique over its predecessor:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      The reduction in optical components by eliminating the need for&#xD;
        chirped pulses&#xD;
    &#xD;
      reduced the device's physical size to less than that of a shoebox (10&#xD;
        times smaller).&#xD;
      simplified the installation process.&#xD;
      reduced the cost of fabrication.&#xD;
      increased the operational lifetime.&#xD;
      enabled its use by non-expert users.&#xD;
    &#xD;
      The use of a longer crystal&#xD;
    &#xD;
      increased the sensitivity by a factor of 10 (pulse lengths of 16fs -&#xD;
        300fs can be measured).&#xD;
      improved the robustness.&#xD;
    &#xD;
	&#xD;
    New product brought to market&#xD;
    The Oxford research was commercialised through an exclusive license to&#xD;
      German company, APE GmbH. APE specialise in devices for generation,&#xD;
      manipulation and measurement of ultrashort laser pulses. APE have 55&#xD;
      employees, and sell products for the ultrafast laser market, directly and&#xD;
      through distributors (e.g. Vereon, Newport, Thorlabs, Photonics Industry)&#xD;
      in 40 countries.&#xD;
    Building on the licensed technology, APE introduced automatic calibration&#xD;
      further simplifying the design. The new device, LX SPIDER, was brought to&#xD;
      market in May 2008. The product is supporting a small group within APE&#xD;
      that is dedicated to laser pulse metrology and the LX SPIDER represents&#xD;
      between [text removed for publication] of APE's total sales. It&#xD;
      retails at approximately [text removed for publication] and [text removed for publication]&#xD;
	  units have been sold to large and small&#xD;
      companies as well as research institutions [A]. LX SPIDER is now the most&#xD;
      common commercially-available method for full characterisation of the&#xD;
      electric field of ultrashort laser pulses.&#xD;
    Benefits to laser manufacturers&#xD;
    Due to the commercialisation of the Oxford research and subsequent&#xD;
      commercial availability through APE of the LX SPIDER, laser performance&#xD;
      can now be specified more completely and easily than was possible a decade&#xD;
      ago. Specification of the pulse shape, as well as its duration, in order&#xD;
      to verify that the pulse is as short as possible is now routinely expected&#xD;
      by buyers of lasers.&#xD;
    Companies who manufacture and sell lasers have used the LX SPIDER to&#xD;
      specify their lasers and incorporated its use into their verification&#xD;
      protocol. For example, Coherent Inc., one of the largest laser&#xD;
      manufacturers and a leading producer of short pulse lasers and amplifiers,&#xD;
      uses LX SPIDER units as a diagnostic tool in their R&amp;amp;D to verify laser&#xD;
      operation, to adjust the laser configuration before shipping and during&#xD;
      installation.&#xD;
    Coherent said that the LX SPIDER "not only gives the pulse duration,&#xD;
        but also spectral phase information, which simplifies and streamlines&#xD;
        the alignment of compressor parameters in order to achieve best possible&#xD;
        compression of amplified pulses. Spectral phase information also allows&#xD;
        for a fast identification of possible issues with optics coatings, that&#xD;
        are not meeting our specs, or even mirror surface flatness issues on&#xD;
        optics that see spectrally spread beams." [B]&#xD;
    Benefits to other end users&#xD;
    Ultrashort optical pulses are used in many applications, including&#xD;
      advanced microscopy, materials processing (including photonic components&#xD;
      for communication and sensing) and biomedicine. A method for pulse&#xD;
      characterisation provides end users with more reliable processes and&#xD;
      results. Where high levels of precision are required, introducing an LX&#xD;
      SPIDER into the experimental configuration has allowed the user to adjust&#xD;
      the optical pulse accurately.&#xD;
    A major market for the LX SPIDER is the commercial research laboratory&#xD;
      sector where it is used by those performing molecular spectroscopy and&#xD;
      microscopy, including the study of molecular dynamics in physical&#xD;
      chemistry, transport studies in biology and for developing solar cells.&#xD;
    Another important set of applications is in nonlinear microscopy, used&#xD;
      especially in biology. Knowing and controlling the shape and duration of&#xD;
      the ultrashort optical pulses used in these techniques is vital to the&#xD;
      generation of high-quality images, since the efficiency of the nonlinear&#xD;
      processes that underpin these techniques depends on the peak intensity of&#xD;
      the input laser pulses.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Invented at the University of Oxford, an instrument for measuring the&#xD;
      temporal shape of ultrashort laser pulses has delivered new capabilities&#xD;
      for users and manufacturers of short-pulse lasers. The device, the LX&#xD;
      SPIDER, is smaller, cheaper and more sensitive than its predecessor. Its&#xD;
      impact has been realised by licensing patented technology to APE GmbH, who&#xD;
      brought the LX SPIDER to market in 2008. Customers are from industrial and&#xD;
      research institutions globally and the device has brought benefits to&#xD;
      users in a variety of sectors including materials processing and&#xD;
      biomedical diagnostics. It is also used by manufacturers of pulsed lasers&#xD;
      in the specification, verification and installation of their laser&#xD;
      products.&#xD;

    The research implements, in a new and simpler way, the concept of&#xD;
      spectral-shearing interferometry, a means to use nonlinear optics to&#xD;
      determine the electric field envelope of an optical pulse using a&#xD;
      deterministic algorithm. In its original incarnation, the Spectral Phase&#xD;
      Interferometry for Direct Electric field Reconstruction (SPIDER) method&#xD;
      was developed by Professor Ian Walmsley while at the University of&#xD;
      Rochester.&#xD;
    The SPIDER technique requires a pair of pulses (the unknown input or&#xD;
      'test` pulse and a time delayed copy) and another pulse, derived from the&#xD;
      same input pulse, which is strongly temporally broadened (`chirped'). A&#xD;
      nonlinear interaction, sum frequency generation, between the long chirped&#xD;
      signal and the test pulses, within a crystal, results in a frequency shift&#xD;
      between the pair. The optical spectrum of the combined signal of the two&#xD;
      pulses reveals the spectral
        phase, as a function of frequency, and thus complete pulse&#xD;
      characterisation.&#xD;
    Although the SPIDER technique worked well, there were a number of&#xD;
      features that if simplified would make the instrument smaller, more robust&#xD;
      and more sensitive. After his arrival in Oxford in 2001, Walmsley set&#xD;
      about simplifying the design. His research at Oxford produced a series of&#xD;
      improvements resulting in a device that was smaller and easier to&#xD;
      integrate into existing laser systems, which enabled its uptake across a&#xD;
      wider group of users.&#xD;
    Walmsley realised the device could be made significantly simpler by&#xD;
      reconfiguring the nonlinear optical process used to generate the spectral&#xD;
      shear (that is, the differential frequency shift between two replicas of&#xD;
      the test pulse spectrum). He designed a phase-matching arrangement that&#xD;
      enabled the spectral shearing to be done in a single step with one&#xD;
      crystal, without needing the chirped signal [1]. The key concept,&#xD;
      group-velocity matching, was also shown theoretically to be very generally&#xD;
      applicable to all nonlinear optical processes [2]. Group-velocity matching&#xD;
      eliminated the need for the chirped pulse and therefore the optics that&#xD;
      produced it, including a bulky and inefficient pulse stretcher [3,4].&#xD;
    In SPIDER, the crystal length was limited by the chirped signal, which&#xD;
      travelled through the crystal at a different speed to the other two pulses&#xD;
      and thus short crystals were used to minimise blurring in the spectral&#xD;
      shear. By removing the need for the chirped signal, all pulses travel with&#xD;
      the same velocity in a single crystal. Walmsley realised he could then use&#xD;
      a longer crystal to perform the sum frequency generation, which would&#xD;
      result in a dramatic increase in frequency conversion efficiency, and thus&#xD;
      improve the sensitivity of the device. The long crystal (LX) method had a&#xD;
      further advantage that the longer, thicker crystals were more robust and&#xD;
      cheaper.&#xD;
    The research was led in Oxford by Professor Ian Walmsley (2001 - present)&#xD;
      with Gorza (postdoctoral researcher 2005 - 2007), Wasylczyk (postdoctoral&#xD;
      researcher 2006 - 2007) and research students Kosik-Williams and Radunsky.&#xD;
    The improvements from the Oxford research described in [2], [3] and [4]&#xD;
      culminated in a new technique, named ARAIGNEE, which was patented in the&#xD;
      US (US7599067, filed 2006, granted 2009) and in the EU (EP1886107, filed&#xD;
      2006, granted 2011). The inventors were Walmsley, Gorza and Radunsky and&#xD;
      the patent was filed by Isis Innovation, the University of Oxford's&#xD;
      technology transfer office.&#xD;

Impact on Commerce&#xD;
A spinout company has been created and established its viability by generating revenue or&#xD;
profits:&#xD;
On the basis of high resolution by X-ray crystallographic structures of fragments that bound to&#xD;
protein targets carried out in the Blundell and Abell laboratories, a spinout company, Astex&#xD;
Technology Ltd, was created in 1999 (Company No. 03751674, incorporated 14/4/1999). The&#xD;
university-based research provided the basis of all subsequent work in Astex, including&#xD;
approximately thirty "campaigns" against many targets, mainly of interest in fighting cancer. In&#xD;
2001 the University of Cambridge invested &amp;#163;250k and was given equity in the company. The&#xD;
company has signed deals in excess of $1.8bn (approximately &amp;#163;1bn) between 1999 and 2011.&#xD;
Investments in Astex have included Abingworth, Apax, Oxford (Boston), Advent, Alta and others&#xD;
with &amp;#163;80 million equity in multiple financing rounds. Astex has also had major collaborations, which&#xD;
involved investments of up to a total of &amp;#163;25 million from GSK, Johnson and Johnson, Novartis and&#xD;
Astra Zeneca, of these the GSK investment occurred after 1/1/2008.1, LC1, LC2 In 2011 Astex&#xD;
Therapeutics was purchased by NASDAQ-listed oncology company SuperGen, Inc. for $150&#xD;
million (ca &amp;#163;100 million). The new company was named Astex Pharmaceuticals, to reflect the&#xD;
strong brand name of Astex.LC1&#xD;
Jobs have been created/protected:&#xD;
Over the past decade, the company has secured constant employment for between 70 and 120&#xD;
workers in Cambridge.LC1 The current number of employees in the UK and US is ~120.&#xD;
Highly skilled people have taken up specialist roles:&#xD;
Astex employs predominantly PhD students from industry and academia (including some from the&#xD;
Abell Group). Employees from Astex have gone on to major roles in academia (Paul Wyatt,&#xD;
Director of the Drug Discovery Unit, Dundee), and industry (Miles Congreve, Vice President of&#xD;
Chemistry, Heptares). Professor Abell was a member of the Astex Board from 1999 - 2000 and&#xD;
has been on its Scientific Advisory Board continuously since its foundation.LC1&#xD;
A business or sector has adopted a new technology or process:&#xD;
Astex changed the way that drug discovery is carried out not only within its own labs but also in&#xD;
other small companies and large pharmaceuticals. The former Head of Worldwide Discovery for&#xD;
Pfizer states: "As a consequence of Astex success, fragment-based approaches are common&#xD;
place throughout Pharma and Biotech, and the power of the technology is also recognised by&#xD;
academia and drug discovery institutes through the UK 3D Fragment consortium, for example.&#xD;
While many companies have in-house capabilities, it is perhaps telling that GSK established a&#xD;
major fragment collaboration with Astex as their internal expertise was apparently not competitive.&#xD;
Importantly, fragments may open the door to blocking protein-protein interactions which would lead&#xD;
to totally new classes of therapeutic agents designed to meet the medical needs of the 21st&#xD;
Century." LC3&#xD;
Most pharmaceutical companies now use fragment-based methods in early discovery. They&#xD;
include J&amp;amp;J, GSK and Astra Zeneca, all of whom have first collaborated with Astex; and UCB,&#xD;
Heptares and Evotec, where Astex employees and/or former members of the Abell and Blundell&#xD;
laboratories have moved to take posts.LC1 &amp;amp; LC2&#xD;
Impact on Health&#xD;
New clinical interventions have been developed:&#xD;
Astex has developed a strong pipeline2 and three drugs that were developed using the fragment-based approach (AT13387, an HSP90 inhibitor; AT7519M, a CDK inhibitor; and AT9283, a&#xD;
JAK/Aurora Inhibitor) are now in Phase II clinical trials for the conditions Gastrointestinal Stromal&#xD;
Tumour (NCT01294202), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (NCT01652144), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia&#xD;
(NCT01652144) and Multiple Myeloma (NCT01145989).3,4,5,6 The same drugs have completed&#xD;
Phase I and are about to enter Phase II for other related clinical conditions (Multiple Myeloma&#xD;
(NCT01183949), Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCT01712217), and Prostate Cancer&#xD;
(NCT01685268)), and in combination with other drugs.7,8,9&#xD;
Early discovery candidates from Astex structure-guided fragment-based drug discovery that are&#xD;
now being taken forward in Phase I trials through collaborating companies include: FGFR Inhibitor&#xD;
JNJ 42756493 (NCT01703481, against Solid Tumours or Lymphoma, taken forward by Janssen&#xD;
Research &amp;amp; Development, LLC), CDK4 Inhibitor LEE011 (eg NCT01747876, against MRT and&#xD;
Neuroblastoma, taken forward by Novartis), PKB/Akt Inhibitor AZD 5363 (eg NCT01692262,&#xD;
against Prostate Cancer, taken forward by Astra Zeneca) and BACE Inhibitor AZD 3293 (eg&#xD;
NCT01795339, against Alzheimers, taken forward by Astra Zeneca).10&#xD;
</ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
In 1999, Chris Abell (Chemistry), Tom Blundell (Biochemistry), and Harren Jhoti co-founded Astex&#xD;
Technology Ltd. to develop an X-ray structure-guided, `fragment-based' approach to drug&#xD;
discovery. This led to a significant change in how the pharmaceutical industry approached drug&#xD;
discovery. Astex Technology Ltd developed four molecules in-house using this approach, which&#xD;
have in 2013 reached Phase I/II clinical trials for various tumours. Four further molecules have&#xD;
been taken into Phase I through collaborations between Astex and Janssen, Novartis and Astra&#xD;
Zeneca. In 2011 the company was sold to SuperGen, Inc., for $150 million (ca &amp;#163;100 million),&#xD;
creating Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., currently with ~120 employees, and a value of &amp;gt;$500 million&#xD;
(&amp;gt; &amp;#163;320 million).&#xD;

The underpinning research was a collaboration between Professor Chris Abell (Professor in&#xD;
Biological Chemistry since 2002; Department of Chemistry since 1984) and Professor Sir Tom&#xD;
Blundell (Sir William Dunn Professor of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry, 1996-2009, and&#xD;
now Research Director), who developed their combined expertise in structural biology and organic&#xD;
chemistry to better understand protein-ligand interactions.&#xD;
Throughout his research career Professor Abell has maintained a strong interest in the mechanism&#xD;
and inhibition of enzymes. This led to increasing collaborative and consultancy involvement with&#xD;
Industry in the 1990s, where high throughput screening was the prevalent method for discovering&#xD;
new hits for drug development. Abell was frustrated by the randomness of this approach, and this&#xD;
fuelled his interest in structure-based approaches to enzyme inhibition. This was facilitated by a&#xD;
major, BBSRC funded collaboration with Professor Tom Blundell on the mechanism, inhibition and&#xD;
structure of enzymes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis.1,2,3&#xD;
In 1998, Blundell and Abell, together with Dr H Jhoti (at the time working at GSK), suggested a&#xD;
novel approach to drug discovery, which underpinned the formation in May 1999 of the spinout&#xD;
company Astex Technology Ltd. The approach was to develop novel therapeutics from very small&#xD;
chemical fragments (MW&amp;lt;300) using high-throughput methods with powerful X-ray sources,&#xD;
together with roboticised data collection, to define at high-resolution complexes of small molecules&#xD;
(fragments). They hypothesised that a library of 300-1000 small fragments could explore chemical&#xD;
space more efficiently than a million-compound library of larger drug-like molecules. The approach,&#xD;
known as fragment-based drug discovery, depended on identifying the positions of fragments&#xD;
bound to the protein by X-ray crystallography and then using knowledge of their positions and the&#xD;
structure of the targets to iteratively elaborate these into potent inhibitors.&#xD;
Research in the laboratories of Abell and Blundell was funded in the University during 1999-2000&#xD;
by a research grant from Astex Technology. The research was carried out by a post-doctoral&#xD;
researcher in the Department of Chemistry (Dr Martyn Frederickson) in collaboration with two post-doctoral researchers in the Department of Biochemistry (Dr Emil Parasini and Dr Anne Cleasby).&#xD;
Multiple crystals of target proteins were screened with a small fragment library in 1999. They&#xD;
demonstrated in 1999-2000 that binding of very small molecules (MW&amp;lt;300) could be detected, and&#xD;
their positions, including orientation, could be defined at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. In&#xD;
two papers, Abell, Blundell and Jhoti describe the concept of X-ray structure-based fragment&#xD;
screening, and the linking and "growing" of fragments across the binding site using X-ray structures&#xD;
as guides.4,5 The significance of their results enabled Abell, Blundell, and Jhoti to raise substantial&#xD;
further funding and develop the spinout company Astex Technology Ltd. Due to commercial&#xD;
sensitivity, from 2001 further research and development was carried out at Astex Technology Ltd,&#xD;
and the early results were not published until 2002.&#xD;

    Microsoft Research has supported, built, and collaborated on a large&#xD;
      number of Office extensions in a number of scientific domains, but the&#xD;
      Chemistry Add-in for Word remains the most highly downloaded project&#xD;
      developed to date, that number exceeding 400,000 as of July 2012. (See&#xD;
      Corroboration Letter LC1).&#xD;
    Chem4Word enables both humans and machines to understand the underlying&#xD;
      semantics of the documented chemistry and expose semantically rich&#xD;
      chemical information across the global chemistry and chemical information&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
    The Chemistry Add-in for Word has been widely recognised by educators,&#xD;
      publishers and software developers as making it easier for students,&#xD;
      educators, and chemists to insert and modify semantically searchable&#xD;
      chemical information, such as labels, formulae and 2D depictions, from&#xD;
      within Microsoft Office Word. Designed for and tested on both Word 2007&#xD;
      and Word 2010, it makes chemistry documents open, readable and easily&#xD;
      accessible, not just to other chemists, but also to other (robotic)&#xD;
      technologies using the widely adopted extensible markup language (XML).&#xD;
      The Chemistry Add-in supports both publishing and data-mining scenarios.1&#xD;
    Impact on Publishing&#xD;
      Chem4Word has been widely welcomed by publishers. The following&#xD;
      testimonials serve as an example of this: "The future of research will be&#xD;
      powered not only by ever more rapid dissemination of ever large quantities&#xD;
      of data, but also by software tools that 'understand' something about&#xD;
      science. These tools will behave intelligently with respect to the&#xD;
      information they process, and will free their human users to spend more&#xD;
      time doing the things that humans do best: generating ideas, designing&#xD;
      experiments and making discoveries. Chem4Word is one of the best examples&#xD;
      so far of this important new development at the interface between science&#xD;
      and technology." Managing Director, Digital Science, Macmillan Publishers.2&#xD;
    "The IUCr is delighted to see the release of v.1 of Chemistry Add-in&#xD;
        for Word under an open-source development license &amp;#8212; this has great&#xD;
        potential for authors to enrich the semantic content of their articles,&#xD;
        and for publishers to leverage this semantic content in creating ever&#xD;
        more useful and powerful active publications." Research and&#xD;
      Development Officer, International Union of Crystallography.2&#xD;
    Impact on Education&#xD;
      Chem4Word is promoted by Microsoft as a tool for teachers and students as&#xD;
      a Chemistry teaching and learning aid.3 &amp;amp; 4&#xD;
    Impact on Open Source Publishing&#xD;
      Much of the work of science depends on having appropriate tools available&#xD;
      to analyse experimental data and to interact with theoretical models.&#xD;
    The Chem4Word research collaboration was unique at the time, with&#xD;
      software development happening both within Microsoft and the University of&#xD;
      Cambridge, and it provided a model for future collaborations between&#xD;
      Microsoft Research and academic institutions worldwide. Additionally, the&#xD;
      Chem4Word project was one of the first Microsoft Research projects for&#xD;
      which it sought public release under an open source licence from the&#xD;
      project's inception. Releasing software in this way was extremely rare for&#xD;
      Microsoft at the time, but was recognised as an important component in&#xD;
      building long-term collaborative development communities. The Chem4Word&#xD;
      project was instrumental in formulating new policy at Microsoft Research&#xD;
      to define and grow a broader open-source strategy, and contributed to the&#xD;
      establishment of the Outercurve Foundation, whose mission is to enable the&#xD;
      exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open&#xD;
      source communities. As a direct result the source code for the Chem4Word&#xD;
      Add-in was released under an open-source licence and the intellectual&#xD;
      property was assigned to the Outercurve Foundation to facilitate broader&#xD;
      community involvement and governance, leading the way for future releases&#xD;
      of Open software via Microsoft and other previously closed vendors.&#xD;
    "Releasing software under open source licenses was extremely rare for&#xD;
        Microsoft at the time, but was recognized as an important component in&#xD;
        building long-term collaborative development communities.&#xD;
        The Chem4Word project helped Microsoft Research to define and grow a&#xD;
        broader open-source strategy, which has led to a large&#xD;
        number of open source releases, and ultimately to the establishment of&#xD;
        the Outercurve Foundation." Quote from Director Scholarly&#xD;
      Communication Microsoft Research (see Corroboration Letter, LC1).&#xD;
    Impact on Chemical Informatics&#xD;
      In 2012, Peter Murray-Rust was a joint recipient (with Henry Rzepa) of the&#xD;
      Herman Skolnik Award presented by the American Chemical Society Division&#xD;
      of Chemical Information, an award that recognises outstanding&#xD;
      contributions to and achievements in the theory and practice of chemical&#xD;
      information science and related disciplines. According to the ACS "Their
        work has had a huge impact in the fields of chemical document analysis,&#xD;
        chemistry on the Internet, and in the orchestration of a viable strategy&#xD;
        for making electronic chemistry information as widely accessible and&#xD;
        usable as possible in our information age."5&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    From 2008-2010, Peter Murray-Rust developed a Chemistry Add-in for&#xD;
      Microsoft Office Word, which enables users to insert and modify&#xD;
      searchable, semantically rich chemical information within a Microsoft word&#xD;
      document and for the data to be stored and manipulated in a semantically&#xD;
      rich manner. The Add-in has been downloaded over 400,000 times. It was one&#xD;
      of the first projects from Microsoft Research for which a public release&#xD;
      under an open source license was obtained. This project demonstrated to a&#xD;
      wide audience new semantic approaches to computing in chemistry. Chem4Word&#xD;
      has impacted on education, publishing and science in industry and&#xD;
      academia.&#xD;

    Peter Murray-Rust joined Cambridge as a lecturer in the Department of&#xD;
      Chemistry in 2000, and then Reader in (2004) until retirement (2008),&#xD;
      remaining research-active in the Department thereafter. Together with&#xD;
      Henry Rzepa (Imperial College London, since 1995) they established the&#xD;
      first fully operational system for managing complex chemical content&#xD;
      entirely in Extensible Markup Language (XML), which defines a set of rules&#xD;
      for encoding documents in a format&#xD;
      that is both human- and machine-readable.&#xD;
      Chemical Markup Language (CML), which adapts XML to chemistry, is the&#xD;
      first and the most ambitious application of semantic computing in&#xD;
      chemistry. CML is the pioneering XML-based language for chemistry,&#xD;
      providing a uniform, extensible system for representing, storing, and&#xD;
      transmitting chemical information. CML supports 4 main methods of creating&#xD;
      semantic chemistry: 1) human authoring (as in conventional articles,&#xD;
      reports, laboratory notebooks, etc.), 2) conversion of chemical data from&#xD;
      legacy formats, 3) creation of semantic chemistry through computer program&#xD;
      output and 4) machine extraction of chemistry from unstructured and&#xD;
      semi-structured material (e.g. electronic chemistry publications). CML&#xD;
      also enables a range of concepts to be modelled, including molecules,&#xD;
      reactions, and chemical metadata. CML has become an important component of&#xD;
      many chemical information systems, including toolkits, structure editors,&#xD;
      and other software.1,2&amp;amp;3&#xD;
    Based on the CML framework and Murray-Rust's vision of creating a simple&#xD;
      way for chemists worldwide to insert "semantically intelligent" chemical&#xD;
      information into documents using existing desktop applications such as&#xD;
      Microsoft Office Word, the Chemistry Add-In for Word (Chem4Word) Project&#xD;
      was initiated in 2008 in a collaboration between the Department of&#xD;
      Chemistry and Microsoft Research. The new Microsoft Office Word format&#xD;
      (.DOCX) would allow for chemical entities to be authored, manipulated, and&#xD;
      stored as CML files within a DOCX package in a user-friendly manner, and&#xD;
      the resulting files could easily be queried and mined for chemical data&#xD;
      whether that was expressed in the document as a name, formula, image, or&#xD;
      bold number reference.&#xD;
    Other chemical drawing tools are available, such as ChemDraw, which is&#xD;
      used by many chemists to create publication-ready, scientifically&#xD;
      meaningful drawings. A limitation of software like ChemDraw is that&#xD;
      individuals, groups and organisations now have a large number of Word&#xD;
      Documents containing embedded ChemDraw objects that cannot easily be&#xD;
      searched in a chemically meaningful way. Additionally, only humans can&#xD;
      create and interpret the chemical structures created by ChemDraw. Other&#xD;
      limitations of some of the currently available software include&#xD;
      limitations on the types of chemical structures that can be created, e.g.&#xD;
      some are limited to only generating organic molecules. The Chem4Word&#xD;
      project set out to simplify the process of inserting and modifying&#xD;
      chemical information from within Microsoft Office Word, and also to have&#xD;
      the chemical information stored and manipulated in a semantically rich&#xD;
      manner. Working closely with Microsoft engineers, Murray-Rust and&#xD;
      colleagues provided the underlying research for the design, semantic&#xD;
      descriptions and ontology, software algorithms, and chemical knowledge for&#xD;
      the program. Microsoft funded a postdoctoral scientist, Dr. Joe Townsend,&#xD;
      to design and implement the software.&#xD;
    Murray-Rust and his group, together with Microsoft Research and the&#xD;
      Microsoft Office Word team, jointly defined and developed the features&#xD;
      that led to beta (March 2010) and version 1.0 (February 2011) releases of&#xD;
      the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Office Word. This Add-in makes it&#xD;
      possible not only to author chemical content in Word, but also to include&#xD;
      the meta-data behind the structures, which means that the chemical&#xD;
      information can be represented in a variety of ways: 2D chemical&#xD;
      structures, names, chemical formulae and importantly, a variety of&#xD;
      semantically encoded data. In other words, instead of a static picture one&#xD;
      can search and select with a few clicks what information should appear in&#xD;
      the embedded fields.4&#xD;
    Chemical Mark-Up Language&#xD;
      In addition to Chem4Word, the following projects (in whole or part&#xD;
      involving the Department of Chemistry Unilever Centre for Molecular&#xD;
      Informatics) have included development of CML specifications, software or&#xD;

    The LAG method developed by the Jones Group is routinely used by industry&#xD;
      to search for new solid forms; in particular with regard to poorly soluble&#xD;
      drugs, which will have limited bioavailability. The approach allows a&#xD;
      complete search of the phase diagram associated with the formation of new&#xD;
      solid forms. In addition, intellectual property can exist for each new&#xD;
      solid form entity. When searching for new forms drug companies want to be&#xD;
      able to screen for all possible forms and develop that form which has the&#xD;
      best physical or chemical attributes. By means of this LAG approach the&#xD;
      phase space can be more efficiently explored, in a shorter time scale,&#xD;
      with smaller amounts of material (important in early stages of development&#xD;
      when sample quantities are small). As a result candidates, which might not&#xD;
      otherwise be suitable for commercialisation, can be developed into&#xD;
      effective solid forms for formulation into drug products. LAG&#xD;
      significantly impacts on how the pharmaceutical industry is able to screen&#xD;
      for and discover new solid drug forms.&#xD;
    A number of pharmaceutical companies are known to currently use LAG as&#xD;
      part of their drug development process, as evidenced by 3 corroborating&#xD;
      statements provided by Amgen, Eli Lilly and Renova Research, and patents&#xD;
      that cite the methodology. Further names of companies that can be&#xD;
      approached to corroborate that they use the technique are listed in&#xD;
      Section 5 and include Pfizer and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.&#xD;
    Quote from Senior Research Advisor, Eli Lilly corroborating letter: "(W)e
        have successfully leveraged LAG in recent years to discover new,&#xD;
        metastable crystal forms, many of which evaded solution-state&#xD;
        crystallization screening...(I)t has been your work around adding small&#xD;
        (catalytic) amounts of solvent that has paved the way for us to access&#xD;
        more highly crystalline and phase pure crystal forms in high yield. In&#xD;
        fact, as a result of your contributions, I am pleased to confirm that&#xD;
        LAG has now been incorporated into our solid form screening strategy for&#xD;
        enabling forms." LC1&#xD;
    Quote from President and CSO, Renova Research, Atlanta, USA,&#xD;
      corroborating letter: "Through my direct interactions and&#xD;
        collaborations with Bill Jones I was able to take advantage of the LAG&#xD;
        concept to create high throughput LAG screening equipment that would&#xD;
        produce 96 experiments in a parallel reaction process. The assistance of&#xD;
        the Jones lab was essential to the success of this effort to produce a&#xD;
        screening platform that could be used in a production contract research&#xD;
        environment." LC2&#xD;
    A search of US Issued patents referring to methods for co-crystallisation&#xD;
      reveals a number of patents that reference the use of LAG and the Jones&#xD;
      Group in their methodology indicating that the technique has been adopted&#xD;
      across a number of Pharmaceutical industries.&#xD;

    Some of the reasons LAG has been so readily adopted by the pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry are listed below:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Drugs, which might otherwise fail because of property issues (e.g.&#xD;
        poor solubility), can be saved by the development of new solid forms and&#xD;
        the LAG method allows rapid screening of a range of potential molecules&#xD;
        to cocrystallise with the drug (the screening step).&#xD;
      The time needed to produce a crystalline form of the drug suitable for&#xD;
        large-scale manufacture is significantly reduced. With typical drug sale&#xD;
        revenues of the top 10 major drug products each being between 6 and 13&#xD;
        billion US$ per annum, a six month increased revenue can be significant&#xD;
        for profits and therefore further support of R &amp;amp; D in other disease&#xD;
        areas.&#xD;
      Approval of the solid form by regulators (e.g. FDA) can be accelerated&#xD;
        by evidence that the proposed marketed form is robust and that a full&#xD;
        screening has been undertaken.&#xD;
      Small amounts of material are required: In initial stages of drug&#xD;
        discovery only small amounts of material are available. The amounts&#xD;
        needed for LAG experiments are small &amp;#8212; of the order of milligrams,&#xD;
        representing a significant cost savings.&#xD;
      There is no need to use large amounts of solvent typical of a solution&#xD;
        screening approach &amp;#8212; with such solvents then being incinerated. This&#xD;
        cuts down on waste and lost revenue.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Evidence of some of the advantages of using LAG, and how LAG has resulted in&#xD;
    economic impacts such as improved business operations, competitiveness and&#xD;
    profitability of industry; as well as environmental impacts through&#xD;
    reductions in solvent and consumable waste streams are available in the&#xD;
    letters of corroboration, with selected quotes listed below:&#xD;
    Quote from Preclinical Director, Amgen, Cambridge MA, U.S.A,&#xD;
      corroborating letter: "(T)his reduction in the number of experiments&#xD;
        has led to tremendous efficiencies in terms of the amount of compound&#xD;
        required, solvent and consumables waste streams, data organization&#xD;
        efforts and time required to conduct and complete experiments." LC3&#xD;
    Quotes from President and CSO, Renova Research, Atlanta, USA,&#xD;
      corroborating letter: "The High Throughput (HT) LAG equipment has had a&#xD;
        significant and positive impact on my business operations. To date I&#xD;
        have used the HT-LAG equipment to produce 16,128 samples (based on the&#xD;
        number of samples logged into the database used to track screening&#xD;
        processes). The time savings compared to performing individual reactions&#xD;
        is enormous. The `hands on' time required to do 16,128 reactions&#xD;
        individually would be approximately 8064 hours, while the number of&#xD;
        hours actually spent creating and analyzing these samples using the&#xD;
        HT-LAG approach was only 1680 hours.&#xD;
    "Without the HT-LAG system the core operational efficiency required to&#xD;
        profitably operate Renovo Research would simply not exist. The LAG&#xD;
        screening process constitutes about half of the sample output in a&#xD;
        typical commercial screening project, thus a significant portion of the&#xD;
        contract research income to Renovo is directly dependent on this&#xD;
        technology. The demonstrated ability to perform rapid and comprehensive&#xD;
        cocrystal screening was instrumental in the acquisition of $500k USD in&#xD;
        investment by a commercial group that contracted with Renovo to rapidly&#xD;
        identify cocrystals of key pharmaceutical ingredients that were&#xD;
        approaching the end of the patent protected lifecycle. Without the&#xD;
        HT-LAG system, Renovo would not have been awarded this contract and&#xD;
        could not have completed it within the aggressive time period required&#xD;
        by the investors."LC2&#xD;

    Research by Professor Jones, Department of Chemistry, University of&#xD;
      Cambridge, resulted in the development of a new method for preparing&#xD;
      composite solids, involving the grinding of two or more crystalline solids&#xD;
      in the presence of small volumes of liquid. This so called "liquid&#xD;
      assisted grinding" (LAG) which produces novel solids with bespoke physical&#xD;
      and chemical properties, is now routinely used by the major pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies to screen for new drug forms as part of their drug product&#xD;

    Liquid Assisted Grinding (LAG) was developed by Prof William Jones who&#xD;
      has been employed as a member of staff in the Chemistry Department,&#xD;
      University of Cambridge, since 1978 (SAIR, 1978; ADR 1985; Reader, 1999;&#xD;
      Professor, 2006 onwards) and leads a research group focused on Materials&#xD;
      Chemistry. The discovery of LAG as an effective screening method was made&#xD;
      in 2001 and published in the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Chemical&#xD;
      Communications in 2002.1 This work demonstrated how the&#xD;
      kinetics of the solid-solid reaction could be accelerated. Prior to this&#xD;
      work solution crystallisation was the main method of doing solid form&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
    The discovery resulted from work in the Jones Group on understanding how&#xD;
      organic molecules pack and interact in the solid state. To expand in a&#xD;
      systematic way the number and types of interactions that were possible&#xD;
      between molecules within an organic crystal structure, from 1995 onwards&#xD;
      the Jones Group investigated methods for preparing crystalline solids with&#xD;
      two or more distinct molecular entities within them.2 This&#xD;
      meant, for example, that to understand how an acid function interacted&#xD;
      with an amine function in a crystal lattice, it was not necessary to have&#xD;
      both functionalities present on the same molecule. To obtain such&#xD;
      multicomponent solids is difficult if the solubility of the two molecules&#xD;
      which are being co-crystallised is very different &amp;#8212; they will simply&#xD;
      crystallise as separate pure phases.&#xD;
    Solid-state grinding had been explored previously by others for producing&#xD;
      co-crystals, but in 2001 the Jones Group embarked on a series of studies&#xD;
      to see whether a small amount of liquid added to the solids during mixing&#xD;
      could have an effect on the outcome. It was discovered in 2001 that not&#xD;
      only did small amounts of liquid speed up the solid-solid reaction but in&#xD;
      numerous cases it allowed the formation of new solid forms that could not&#xD;
      otherwise be made. The method has now been termed "liquid assisted&#xD;
      grinding". The group disclosed this discovery in 2002 where the enhanced&#xD;
      kinetics was noted.1 Between 2002 and 2005 the Jones Group&#xD;
      discovered that the exact outcome of the solid state grinding could be&#xD;
      controlled by careful choice of the added liquid.3Between&#xD;
      2005 and 2007 it was further demonstrated that this LAG approach is&#xD;
      significantly more effective in searching for alternate solid forms of&#xD;
      drug candidates than other previously used methods, e.g. conventional&#xD;
      solution crystallisation or melt growth.4&amp;amp;5 LAG is a method&#xD;
      that requires very small amounts of material, essential for preformulation&#xD;
      pharmaceutical development, is rapid, and environmentally friendly because&#xD;
      it eliminates the need to use large amounts of solvents.&#xD;
    A recent independent study comparing the effectiveness of the various&#xD;
      approaches to screening for new forms of the drug piroxicam is given by&#xD;
      Fucke, et al (2012).6 The authors conclude that: "Solvent-drop
        grinding showed the highest absolute number of experiments resulting in&#xD;
        co-crystals" and ""For an initial screening solvent drop grinding&#xD;
        should be preferred, as this method produced reliably co-crystal forms."&#xD;
    In the pharmaceutical industry many drug candidates in their pure form&#xD;
      suffer from very poor physical and chemical attributes. An example is the&#xD;
      increasingly common problem of poor solubility and bioavailability. To&#xD;
      improve solubility the pharmaceutical industry routinely searches for&#xD;
      alternative solid forms of the drug, e.g. formation of salt and/or&#xD;
      co-crystal forms. The prior established practice of screening by&#xD;
      conventional crystallisation from solution is particularly difficult&#xD;
      because drug and coformer will tend to crystallise separately.&#xD;
    The LAG research was supported by Pfizer grants. The following staff&#xD;
      members working in the Jones Group contributed to the underpinning&#xD;
      research: Delia Haynes (PDRA 2002-2005) and Tomislav Frisic (PDRA&#xD;
      2005-2007). Additionally, Dr Sam Motherwell from the Cambridge&#xD;
      Crystallographic Data Centre (1992-present) provided database support; and&#xD;
      Professor Fumio Toda (Matsuyama, Japan (deceased)) provided background&#xD;
      information on solid-solid grinding. Members of the Jones Group also&#xD;
      included PhD students Ning Shan (PhD 2000-2003), Andrew Trask (PhD 2002&#xD;
      -2005) and Shyam Karki (PhD 2006 -2009).&#xD;

    Wood and Plester's empirical research has not only challenged the
      conventional tabloid wisdom
      that textism use is detrimental to the reading ability of children, it has
      initiated a new line of
      empirical academic research and directly impacted on public policy and
      practitioners' use of texting
      language in their teaching.
    Impact dissemination process and dates
    The initial data [1] was published in a practitioner journal in order to
      generate discussion amongst
      teachers and within schools regarding how mobile phones were perceived by
      educators. As a
      result of this paper and the media debate stimulated, Wood was
      seconded to Becta for a three-
      month period from January 2010, to review the academic evidence of which
      technologies improve
      English skills in school children, which included the mobile phone
      research. The Becta review is
      available via the Institute of Education's Digital Resources Archive (http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/1670/).
    In December 2012 Wood was invited to present a seminar at the
      Department for Education on the
      potential of technology to impact on children's literacy, which reviewed
      the research evidence on e-
      books and mobile phone use including Wood's own research. Wood
      was then asked to review
      and comment on the draft National Curriculum for English in Key Stages 1
      and 2 with respect to its
      treatment of technology. Wood's seminar was also attended by
      OFSTED and Dyslexia Action, and
      Wood was invited to discuss her work in more detail with these
      organisations in 2013. Coventry
      data [2] was referred to by Crystal in his book `Txting: the Gr8 Db8', and
      the findings [2,3] were
      also widely disseminated to the general public via a published case study
      on the British Academy
      website [a] and through mainstream national and international media
      [b,c,d,e]. Becta then funded
      the intervention study [5] to examine the question of whether mobile phone
      ownership could boost
      literacy attainment in primary school children. Most recently, Wood's
      research [1,2,3,4,5] was
      covered in the BBC4 documentary series `Growing Children' as part of the
      programme on dyslexia,
      screened in August 2012 (average daily reach for BBC4 in the week it was
      screened: 2.3 million
      viewers).
    Following the media coverage of the research, Wood was invited to
      be a keynote speaker at the
      Youth Libraries Group (YLG) annual conference, with 200 delegates
      from across the UK (2009).
      The presentation included reviews of her research with respect to
      technology and literacy, and
      discussed the ways in which technology is best integrated with the
      curriculum. The Youth Libraries
        Group presentation was published as a book chapter in `Read to
      Succeed', a text aimed at
      librarians who work with children and young people (Wood, C. 2011.
      `How children begin to read'.
      In: Court, J. (Ed.) Read to Succeed: Strategies to Engage Children and
      Young People in Reading
      for Pleasure (pp15-28). London: Facet. Sales figures: 670). Wood
      was also invited to be a panel
      member by the National Literacy Trust at the launch of their 2012 annual
      survey results. The
      survey found children are more likely to read via digital sources than
      traditional print media, and
      Wood's research was identified as an important contribution to the
      debate about the potential of
      technology to impact positively on children's literacy [f].
    Beneficiaries Primary and secondary school teachers,
      trainee teachers, youth and school
      librarians, parents, school-age children.
    Nature of the impact and evidence
    The text messaging research has impacted on public attitudes in
      relation to popular perceptions
      and understandings of how mobile phones may influence the development of
      young people's
      written language skills. Prior to the publication of the research [1]
      there was an accepted popular
      media argument that text messaging was responsible for the apparent
      decline in literacy
      attainment amongst children. For example, in the Guardian http://tinyurl.com/oyf4hof
      and famously,
      in the Daily Mail http://tinyurl.com/y7g7lvc.
      Wood's research examined these questions empirically,
      and directly challenged the assumptions about the negative impact of
      texting behaviour. As a direct
      result of the Coventry research, online blogs and media coverage worldwide
      now increasingly
      challenges the idea of textism use being detrimental to young people's
      literacy skills, citing the
      Plester and Wood's research as evidence [for example: b,c,d,e,f].
    The work has begun to impact on public policy within the Department
        for Education (DfE).
      Following the DfE seminar in December 2012, Wood's research [2]
      was incorporated into a
      Department for Education report on research evidence on writing [g]. The
      report acknowledged
      that there was now evidence that texting could make a positive
      contribution to children's
      phonological awareness. Wood's research has also impacted the work
      of the National Literacy
      Trust [f]. Director, Jonathan Douglas, states "We have used it as a
        central evidence base for our
        policy work with the Department for Education. It has stimulated further
        research which the
        National Literacy Trust itself has undertaken. It has also supported new
        practices in teaching
        literacy in the 900 National Literacy Trust schools, members of our
        network who develop and share
        innovative evidence-based approaches to literacy...It has helped us to
        understand the contribution
        that texting and informal digital communication makes to formal skills
        associated with writing. We
        have taken this exploration further with our own research which
        demonstrates that blogging in
        leisure time impacts positively on writing skills... It has helped us
        understand the importance of
        phonological awareness in developing writing skills and that this
        awareness can be developed in a
        playful and relevant way. This emphasises the importance of
        contextualising literacy pedagogy in
        real life interests and experiences. This has fed into programmes such
        as the National literacy
        Trust's Premier League Reading stars project which operates in 1,000
        English schools."
    In terms of impact on practitioners, there is evidence that
      innovative teachers worldwide were
      beginning to use `text-speak' to aid learning English prior to the
      publication of Wood and Plester's
      empirical research. For example, teachers were using it in Scotland and
      the Scottish Qualifications
      Authority (SQA) came under fire for allowing children to write answers in
      text speak, as long as
      they showed an understanding for the subject, although pupils who used
      phrases such as "2b r nt
      2b" or "i luv u" would not be able to get top marks' [h]. This example is
      taken from an article about
      Wood's research, which suggests even where Plester and Wood's
      work may not have inspired the
      use of texting in education, it may have contributed to legitimizing it.
      In the US, the best selling
      book `Teaching Generation Text: Using Cell Phones to Enhance Learning'
      outlines stories from
      educators, parents, students, counsellors and anyone using cell phones to
      enhance learning -
      suggesting it is currently taking place in the classroom [i]. The blog
      associated with the book [j]
      directly references Wood's research, and the value of text
      messaging in teaching. It also outlines
      how the research could be employed in the classroom such as to translate
      poetry into `text-speak'
      in order to aid understanding and create useful summaries.
    The research is also endorsed by Marc Slater who developed Ultimate
      Spelling software, a widely
      used worldwide spelling software programme for students. He has commented
      in a recent press
      release, "This latest research is very interesting. For texting to help
        kids spell, it sounds great. We
        just hope that research continues to support these findings as texting
        seems to be more and more
        a part of everyday life." (http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/10/prweb9955790.htm)
    Conclusion
    Wood and Plester's pioneering rigorous empirical research has
      changed the way that the public,
      policy makers and educators worldwide view, accept and use text-speak to
      develop English
      Language Skills in children and adolescents: "The full implications of
        the research to policy makers
        and practitioners have yet to be fully grasped. They are challenging
        and, I believe, must lead to
        questioning of how literacy is taught and assessed. And indeed what
        literacy is. For this reason I
        see this research as being at the very cutting edge of the global debate
        which is defining what it
        means to be literate in a society driven by, and delighting in, digital
        communication" &amp;#8212; Jonathan
      Douglas, Director of the National Literacy Trust.

        alleged detrimental impact of texting on
        children's understanding of standard English;
       Public policy on literacy in England by informing Department
        for Education and National
        Literacy Trust reports and research regarding the value of informal
        language use to written
        language skills;
       Practitioners in the UK and worldwide, who now use text
        language as a way of teaching
        English to young people.

    Wood and Plester led research internationally into the
      relationship between text messaging and
      children's literacy development. They were the first to demonstrate
      empirically that the associations
      between textism use (use of text abbreviations / alternative spellings)
      and literacy outcomes were
      positive, and that textism use may contribute causally to children's
      spelling development over time.
      The team were also the first to investigate the educational impact of
      giving 9-10-year-old children
      mobile phones for text messaging. Their research revealed no evidence of
      detrimental impact, and
      some evidence of positive contribution to spelling outcomes. They also
      found that children with
      dyslexia appear to avoid using the textism types that best support
      literacy development. These
      studies have been cited as the basis for other work that has been
      conducted internationally and
      which has replicated and extended these findings (e.g. Coe &amp;amp; Oakhill,
      2011; Kemp and Bushnell,
      2011; Durkin, Conti-Ramsden &amp;amp; Walker, 2011; Powell &amp;amp; Dixon, 2011;
      Drouin, 2011; Grace, et al,
      2012). Prior to the publication of these papers, interest in text-speak
      was limited to linguistic
      analyses by Thurlow (2006) and Crystal (2008), who argued against the
      media portrayal of texting
      as problematic for children's literacy. However there was no published
      empirical test of this claim.
    In 2005-6, Plester (Senior Lecturer at Coventry until retirement in 2009
      then honorary research
      fellow) and Wood (Reader then Professor at Coventry throughout)
      conducted exploratory work to
      examine whether there was any evidence of an association between text
      messaging behaviour
      and academic outcomes. They found that children (N=65) who were more
      frequent texters tended
      to do less well on tests of cognitive ability than children who texted
      less frequently. However,
      children who used more textisms during a text translation task tended to
      have better verbal
      reasoning scores. Data was then collected on a further sample of children
      (N=35) who completed a
      spelling task and another text translation task. It was found that the
      children who used the most
      textisms were the children who tended to score most highly on the test of
      standard spelling ability
      [1]. Although small-scale and exploratory, this was the very first paper
      published on this topic.
      Literacy is a practitioner journal which is read by members of the
      United Kingdom Literacy
      Association, mainly teachers and teacher educators. Wood and
      Plester's paper is the single most
      downloaded (6,045 downloads between 2008 and 2011) and cited paper in the
      journal's history,
      and was shortlisted for the UKLA Literacy Publication Award in 2009.
    This was followed up by a larger scale study (N=88) in 2006-7
      investigating the relationships
      between children's use of textisms in a simulated text messaging task and
      variables such as verbal
      reasoning ability, spelling, reading and phonological awareness. It was
      hypothesised that
      phonological awareness was the variable mediating the relationship between
      textism usage and
      literacy scores, as this skill underpins literacy and most textisms are
      phonetic spellings. The
      research found that there was significant shared variance between
      phonological awareness and
      textism use, but also found that textism use could still explain the
      unique variance in reading ability
      after controlling for individual differences in a wide range of other
      contributing variables [2]. This is
      the single most cited paper published in the British Journal of
      Developmental Psychology during
      the REF census period, attracting almost twice as many citations as the
      second most cited paper.
    Subsequently, the British Academy funded Wood to conduct a
      longitudinal study (2007-9) to
      investigate whether the patterns observed were indicative of causal
      relationships over one
      academic year. This study (N=119) was both the first substantial
      longitudinal study to examine the
      impact of textism use on the development of children's reading and
      spelling over time, and the first
      to use samples of children's actual text messages, rather than tasks that
      simulated text messaging
      behaviour. It was also the first to determine the direction of causality
      in the previously reported
      positive relationships between textism use and literacy outcomes. Once
      again the research found
      that children's textism use could predict unique variance in their
      spelling development over time,
      but spelling and reading development could not predict textism use,
      indicating a unidirectional
      causal relationship [3]. Given these results, a related research question
      was explored, to determine
      whether children with dyslexia displayed the same pattern of results.
      Additional data collected in
      2008-9 showed that children with dyslexia appeared to use fewer phonetic
      textisms than their
      typically developing peers, and that the observed relationships between
      literacy variables and
      textism use were not observed in the sample with dyslexia [4].
    Subsequently, Wood conducted the first intervention study to
      examine the impact of giving mobile
      phones to primary school children as a form of literacy intervention. Wood
      led a Becta-funded
      randomised control study in 2010 (N=114), giving mobile phones to 9-10
      year-old children to use
      every weekend over a 10-week period. The research collated detailed
      information on the children's
      phone usage, monitoring the numbers of messages sent and received, as well
      as textism use. This
      study found no evidence of a significant benefit of text messaging over
      this period when compared
      to that of the control group. However, when the intervention group's data
      was analysed
      longitudinally, the contribution of textism use to spelling development
      found previously [3] was also
      found in this sample [5].

    Overview&#xD;
    The primary impact of the Newcastle PARP project is the development of&#xD;
      the anticancer drug&#xD;
      Rucaparib. In addition, the Newcastle research has stimulated PARP&#xD;
      research worldwide, which&#xD;
      has led to further potent inhibitors. PARP research now embraces the&#xD;
      global pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry (over 10 companies), with 33 cancer trials involving PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors completed and an&#xD;
      additional 52 trials currently open. Through these trials (50 Phase I, 33&#xD;
      Phase II and 2 Phase III)&#xD;
      more than 7000 patients exhibiting 8 types of cancer have been treated&#xD;
      with a PARP-1 inhibitor so&#xD;
      far, including more than 200 patients who have received Rucaparib. The&#xD;
      successful exploitation of&#xD;
      PARP has established:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      
Structure-based drug design (SBDD) as a major tool in cancer&#xD;
        drug discovery.&#xD;
      DNA damage repair as a viable target.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Beneficiaries&#xD;
    The research has had a significant impact on the global pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry, with companies&#xD;
      such as AstraZeneca, Clovis, Sanofi-Aventis, Abbott, Merck, Biomarin,&#xD;
      Eisai, Cephalon and&#xD;
      Genentech having invested heavily in clinical trials and clinical PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor programmes [E1].&#xD;
      Since the initial clinical trials in Newcastle in which patients were&#xD;
      treated with a PARP inhibitor for&#xD;
      the first time, there has been a twenty-fold increase in the commencement&#xD;
      of trials testing PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors [data extracted from E1].&#xD;
    Since the initial Phase 1 trial in 2003, more than 7000 cancer patients&#xD;
      (approximately 750 of which&#xD;
      have been recruited to more than one phase) have entered clinical trials&#xD;
      involving PARP inhibitors&#xD;
      [E1]. Five thousand six-hundred of these patients were enrolled&#xD;
      since 2008. These trials include&#xD;
      patients with ovarian cancer (incidence rate in the UK: 21 cases for every&#xD;
      100,000 women), breast&#xD;
      cancer (157 new breast cancer cases for every 100,000 women and 1 for&#xD;
      every 100,000 males in&#xD;
      the UK) and prostate cancer (134 new prostate cancer cases for every&#xD;
      100,000 males in the UK;&#xD;
      [E2]). Thirty-three cancer trials involving PARP inhibitors have&#xD;
      been completed with an additional&#xD;
      52 trials currently open, totalling 50 Phase I, 33 Phase II and 2 Phase&#xD;
      III trials [E1]. In 2011 the&#xD;
      average per patient cost associated with a Phase I, II and III trial in&#xD;
      Oncology were reported to be&#xD;
      $21,883, $73,303 and $65,900 respectively [E3]. Therefore, an&#xD;
      estimated $385 million US dollars&#xD;
      has been invested into PARP inhibitor trials in the period 2008-2013.&#xD;
    In the earliest clinical trials of Rucaparib (2003 and 2005), although&#xD;
      some patients had a life&#xD;
      expectancy of only a few months, two treated in 2003 in the first clinical&#xD;
      trial and five from a 2005&#xD;
      Phase II study with one exception are still alive and cancer-free [E4].&#xD;
      In one Phase II trial,&#xD;
      treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib has significantly reduced the&#xD;
      size of tumours in 38 % of&#xD;
      breast cancer patients (9 of 24 patients) [E5]. Similarly, a Phase&#xD;
      II trial showed that this drug was&#xD;
      well tolerated in ovarian cancer patients with hereditary breast-ovarian&#xD;
      cancer syndrome, with 33%&#xD;
      (11 of 33 patients) showing reduced tumour size [E6].&#xD;
    As a consequence of Newcastle's PARP research, several other DNA damage&#xD;
      and repair targets&#xD;
      are now being explored and Newcastle is involved in many of these, e.g.&#xD;
      ATM, ATR, CHK1/2 and&#xD;
      DNA PK.&#xD;

    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Newcastle University research discovered the first potent inhibitors of&#xD;
      the DNA repair enzyme poly&#xD;
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) through medicinal chemistry and&#xD;
      preclinical work leading to&#xD;
      first-in-man clinical studies. This research led to the development of&#xD;
      Rucaparib, an agent that&#xD;
      inhibits the ability of cancer cells to survive drug treatments or&#xD;
      radiotherapy. As a result of&#xD;
      Newcastle's research a further 8 PARP inhibitors are in development. Major&#xD;
      pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies have invested an estimated $385 million in clinical trials, with&#xD;
      at least 7000 patients&#xD;
      enrolled in PARP inhibitor trials since 2008. Cancer patients worldwide&#xD;
      have already been&#xD;
      successfully treated with these new anti-cancer drugs.&#xD;

    Although many cancer patients are successfully treated with drugs there&#xD;
      is an urgent need for&#xD;
      better drugs for some of the most prevalent cancers including breast,&#xD;
      ovarian and prostate. Prior to&#xD;
      1993, inhibitors of PARP-1 were studied by Professor B Durkacz (1982-2009&#xD;
        &amp;#8212; Professor of&#xD;
        Experimental Cancer Therapeutics; Northern Institute of Cancer&#xD;
        Research (NICR), Newcastle&#xD;
        University), but were of insufficient potency for clinical use.&#xD;
      Following these initial observations, a&#xD;
      translational research effort was instituted between the NICR and Golding&#xD;
      (1983 to date &amp;#8212;&#xD;
        Professor of Organic Chemistry) and Griffin (1990 to date&#xD;
        &amp;#8212; Professor of Medicinal Chemistry) in&#xD;
      the School of Chemistry. After considering the mode of action of PARP-1,&#xD;
      we conceived&#xD;
      benzimidazole and quinazolinone derivatives as possible effective&#xD;
      inhibitors [P1, P2] A synthetic&#xD;
      program was initiated, which led by 1995 to potent benzimidazole and&#xD;
      quinazolinone inhibitors.&#xD;
      These were much more effective than previously studied compounds and led,&#xD;
      in collaboration with&#xD;
      industrial partners (initially Agouron Pharmaceuticals), to the&#xD;
      first-in-class clinical candidate by&#xD;
      2000 [P3-P6].&#xD;
    The primary contributions from Newcastle research was thus the design of&#xD;
      new structural motifs for&#xD;
      inhibition of PARP-1 and devising efficient synthetic routes to libraries&#xD;
      of drug-like molecules&#xD;
      needed to exemplify the concept. The discovery of potent benzimidazole&#xD;
      inhibitors of PARP-1&#xD;
      enabled the support of a major pharmaceutical partner to be secured:&#xD;
      initially Agouron&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, world leaders in structure-based drug design (SBDD),&#xD;
      which was an emerging&#xD;
      technique in the 1990s. With the help of crystal structures of Newcastle&#xD;
      inhibitors bound to PARP-1&#xD;
      protein, the number of molecules synthesised through the collaboration&#xD;
      between the School of&#xD;
      Chemistry and Agouron chemists led to the identification of the clinical&#xD;
      candidate Rucaparib&#xD;
      (AG014699, PF-01367338). This partnership was noteworthy because it came&#xD;
      at a time when drug&#xD;
      resistance modifiers and chemo-/radio-potentiators were considered to be&#xD;
      of limited commercial&#xD;
      value by the pharmaceutical sector. Our persistence and research therefore&#xD;
      validated PARP as a&#xD;
      viable target despite this prevailing attitude.&#xD;
    Preclinical research by the NICR validated the identified compounds as&#xD;
      inhibitors of the target&#xD;
      enzyme. Potentiation of the activity of alkylating agents (e.g.&#xD;
      temozolomide) and topoisomerase I&#xD;
      inhibitors (e.g. topotecan) was demonstrated in cell lines and also in&#xD;
      xenograft models. The much&#xD;
      wider clinical potential for PARP-1 inhibitors was shown by potentiation&#xD;
      of ionising radiation and of&#xD;
      cytotoxic drugs in a range of tumour types. After the clinical candidate&#xD;
      Rucaparib had been&#xD;
      identified, the Newcastle clinical team, with the support of Cancer&#xD;
      Research UK (Drug&#xD;
      Development Office), designed and executed a first-in-human,&#xD;
      first-in-class Phase I study of this&#xD;
      compound in combination with temozolomide. This study was designed to&#xD;
      provide both safety data&#xD;
      and proof-of-mechanism of action in a surrogate tissue and also in tumour&#xD;
      biopsies. It was one of&#xD;
      the first Phase I studies to rely on a therapeutic (pharmacodynamic)&#xD;
      endpoint rather than toxicity&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics alone. The Newcastle PARP-1 team was also closely&#xD;
      involved in the&#xD;
      preclinical research that first demonstrated synthetic lethality with PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors in BRCA&#xD;
      defective cell lines and proposed the first proof-of-principal Phase II&#xD;
      study investigating this aspect.&#xD;
    In 2010, the PARP research team won Cancer Research UK's Translational&#xD;
      cancer research prize&#xD;
      which "...recognises a team who have made a significant impact on the&#xD;
        continuing effort to&#xD;
        prevent, diagnose and cure cancer, and whose research is at the cutting&#xD;
        edge of scientific novelty"&#xD;
      (http://science.cancerresearchuk.org/news/prize-winners-2010-announced).&#xD;
      The intramural&#xD;
      Newcastle PARP team that initiated the project embraced medicinal&#xD;
      chemistry (Golding, Griffin),&#xD;
      molecular, cell and in vivo pharmacology (Curtin, 1989-date &amp;#8212;&#xD;

    Station 9.8, with its unique design developed by Newcastle University
      researchers, was the first dedicated facility of its kind in the world.
      Its rapid and large oversubscription prompted the decision by SRS to
      establish a second similar station by reallocation of an underused powder
      diffraction beamline (16.2) a few years later. Both facilities operated
      until mid-2008 and provided the model, inspiration and (through high
      demand from users) justification for current facilities in the UK and
      worldwide. Impact from commercial work using these facilities typically
      develops over many subsequent years, as illustrated by specific examples
      given below.
    Impact on the development of other synchrotron facilities
    The success of Station 9.8 led to the design principles being used
      subsequently in plans for other similar facilities worldwide, particularly
      the beamline I19 at Diamond Light Source (DLS), effectively a direct UK
      replacement for Station 9.8 from 2008 [E1], and the Advanced Light Source
      in California, USA (ALS, conversion of beamline 11.3.1 from threatened
      closure in 2006 to the most productive beamline from 2009), and to the
      successful cases for development of these facilities as a result of its
      immense popularity and success. These two are the only current dedicated
      beamlines of their kind in the world and are unrivalled in their output by
      any shared- use facilities [E2, E3]; such other facilities include
      beamlines at APS (USA) and Soleil (France), themselves influenced
      indirectly by the design principles and the success of Station 9.8.
    DLS is the largest UK Government-funded science project in a generation,
      costing around &amp;#163;400M in its construction to date and with an annual
      operating budget rising from the initial &amp;#163;23M in 2007-2008 as beamlines
      are added; it provides a high level of employment and contribution to the
      local economy. The I19 beamline had a construction budget of around &amp;#163;5M
      and its annual operating budget is &amp;#163;430K excluding support for an average
      of 3 PhD students per year; it has a full-time staff of 4 scientists and
      technical support equivalent to 1.25 FTE.
    In addition to providing the model for such facilities, the original
      research has also produced leading scientists to manage and operate them.
      Of grant-funded research staff employed for the construction and
      commissioning stages of SRS 9.8, one is now Staff Scientist for ALS 11.3.1
      (Dr Simon Teat, previously beamline scientist at SRS and Principal
      Beamline Scientist for DLS I19), and another is a director of the
      EPSRC-funded NCS (Dr Simon Coles). Major users/beneficiaries of SRS 9.8
      who are now in commercial and public service employment include Dr David
      Allan (Principal Beamline Scientist for DLS I19), Dr Neil Feeder (Pfizer
      then CCDC), and Dr Elizabeth Shotton (Industrial Liaison Manager, DLS).
      Clegg has also helped provide training for over 150 staff and users of
      synchrotron facilities from many countries through Synchrotron Radiation
      Summer Schools, formerly at Chester/Daresbury [E4 p.69] and currently at
      Oxford/Diamond.
    Impact through commercial use of facilities
    Around 10 commercial companies made use of SRS Station 9.8 up to 2008,
      including all the major UK pharmaceutical firms; 5 companies from the
      pharmaceutical and chemical sectors of UK industry currently use DLS
      beamline I19 (one reason for the lower number is company mergers). These
      companies are prepared to pay full-cost-recovery commercial rates for
      access, since there is usually no other feasible way for them to obtain
      vital structural information for the development and marketing of their
      products when the available materials are poorly diffracting [E5].
      Confidentiality agreements between the facilities and commercial customers
      make it impossible to provide details of such usage, but we give some
      examples here where results have been published or approved by company
      representatives, or where the work is commercially-sponsored research by
      academic partner teams; they are undoubtedly typical of other work. At
      DLS, as previously at SRS, several days of beamtime in each 6-month
      operating schedule are allocated to commercial work and a day of beamtime
      can deliver up to 10 or more data sets, as an indication of overall usage.
      Without the original Newcastle underpinning research, these opportunities
      would probably not exist and the key structures would remain unknown.
    For example, Organon (now Merck) used SRS 9.8 to investigate the
      structure of a cyclodextrin complexed with a drug used as a neuromuscular
      blocker, to confirm its mode of action. Sugammadex is now marketed as
      Bridion; it was approved for use in the EU in 2008 and sales to date have
      been around &amp;#163;300M [E6; E4 pp. 7 &amp;amp; 93].
    Roche Discovery Welwyn, part of Hoffman LaRoche, carried out structural
      studies at SRS 9.8, concentrating on active pharmaceutical ingredients,
      intermediates and impurities in support of anti-inflammatory and
      anti-viral programmes. This work contributed to the development of the
      influenza neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and the
      first-generation HIV protease inhibitor Invirase (saquinavir mesylate),
      both originally licensed for use in the 1990s and in continued use today
      [E7]. Tamiflu has had particularly high public profile and impact in
      recent years as a major treatment during several big flu outbreaks around
      the world. In the UK alone the NHS has spent an average of around &amp;#163;70M per
      year maintaining stocks of Tamiflu; annual worldwide sales peaked in 2009
      and 2010 at around &amp;#163;550M, then reduced by over 50%.
    Commercial use of the SRS facilities was taken over by DLS I19 beamline
      from 2009. Anhydrous sodium diclofenac was a key structure obtained by
      SAFC Pharmorphix (Sigma-Aldrich) using DLS I19, enabling a thorough study
      of relative stability of hydrates and other crystalline forms of this
      common painkiller, which is one of the top 100 drugs in international use,
      with an estimated annual value of about &amp;#163;820M in 2009 [E7, E8 p.5, E9].
      This work is typical of polymorphism and solvate studies carried out by
      pharmaceutical companies, requiring synchrotron facilities for unstable
      and poorly crystalline forms of important drugs and drug candidates in
      order to secure and protect intellectual property rights attributable to
      particular solid forms [E7].
    Other major pharmaceutical firms who have confirmed their use of these
      facilities in order to obtain or improve vital drug development structures
      and to support regulatory and patent processes are Pfizer and
      GlaxoSmithKlyne.
    Impact through commercialisation or Government use of academic
        research
    Zeolites and metal-organic framework materials studied by St Andrews
      chemists at SRS, DLS and ALS have led to Chevron Texaco patents on two
      materials, SSZ-23 and SSZ-51, for use in oil refineries, three patents
      related to storage and release of nitric oxide, and two spin-out
      companies, Zeomedix LLC (started in 2009 with over $1M of external
      investment to date) and MOFgen Ltd (started in 2013 with 14 commercial
      agreements with other companies) [P3, E4 p.51, E10]. Metal-organic
      frameworks have become popular research projects, of interest for
      potential in hydrogen and other gas storage and energy applications. Work
      is often industrially sponsored, such as that by Nottingham University
      supported by General Motors [E7, p.17].
    ALS 11.3.1 is used in projects of the US Department of Energy, including
      gas separations for clean air technology, extraction of uranium from sea
      water, and nuclear reprocessing [E2].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    This case study describes impact from the Newcastle-led research project
      to construct the world's first dedicated single-crystal diffraction
      synchrotron beamline for chemistry and materials science at Daresbury
      Laboratory Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS). The result was an
      innovative and productive facility that has served as the model for the
      development of other facilities internationally, especially at Diamond
      Light Source (UK) and the Advanced Light Source (USA). The original
      Newcastle University research has helped produce scientists now employed
      by industry and public service sectors around the world. Major new and
      beneficial drugs and catalysts have been developed with the aid of the
      synchrotron beamlines and work conducted at these facilities has been
      critically important for the advancement of the global chemical and
      pharmaceutical industries and US Government energy development programmes.

    Crystal structure determination is crucial to our understanding of the
      properties of materials and is of fundamental importance in physical and
      life sciences. The technique faces ever-increasing demands for the study
      of more complex molecular systems. The years 1994-1997 were the main
      period of a major Newcastle-led research project to design, construct and
      commission a single-crystal diffraction beamline (Station 9.8) at the SRS,
      recognising the need for a facility that could greatly extend the range of
      materials not otherwise amenable to conventional laboratory equipment.
      Before Station 9.8 was built there were no dedicated facilities available
      for the study of crystals with one or more dimensions on the micron scale
      or other very weak scatterers, as laboratory facilities were not
      sufficient, and so many important structural insights were lost.
    The project team, led by Clegg, designed and set up Station 9.8 using a
      modified laboratory diffractometer and detector system with X-ray optical
      components in a novel combination to ensure that the equipment would
      function successfully with the synchrotron source and also to combat
      constraints of the available space. Other challenges overcome were the
      needs for appropriate control and processing procedures and software, and
      requirements for handling a wide range of samples, including air-sensitive
      materials, to ensure maximum applicability [P1]. A primary objective was
      to offer a familiar setup to a non-specialist first-time synchrotron user.
    Overall project leadership and direction was maintained throughout by
      Clegg, on site half-time at Daresbury from 1995 to 1998 through formal
      Joint Appointments financed as research grants to Newcastle University to
      cover 50% of salary costs; he was responsible for key decisions regarding
      the choice of equipment, software and postdoctoral staffing as well as
      conducting the extensive commissioning work using samples provided by
      chemists from around the UK and abroad. Station 9.8 was the first
      dedicated facility of its kind anywhere in the world [P2] and has enjoyed
      immense success and productivity from the first commissioning data
      measurement. In 1997, in accordance with the original plan and EPSRC grant
      conditions, it was formally handed over by Newcastle University as a full
      SRS user facility, on schedule, within budget, and with performance
      exceeding the design specifications. It quickly became one of the most
      heavily oversubscribed beamlines at Daresbury, with academic and
      commercial users, generating between 10 and 20% of SRS-based publications
      in subsequent years [P3, P4, P5 &amp;amp; P6].
    Continued use of the facility beyond 1997, and of its direct successor at
      Diamond Light Source after 2008, by Clegg's Newcastle research group
      included the establishment of a synchrotron-based component of the EPSRC
      National Crystallography Service (NCS) in 2001, which further raised the
      profile of the beamline and introduced its benefits to a wide range of UK
      chemists, some of whom subsequently became commercial users, while others
      were carrying out research projects with industrial partners; this
      attraction of a large user community contributed hugely to the success of
      the proposal to construct Diamond beamline I19.

    It is widely accepted that computation and simulation is a driver of&#xD;
      economic growth. The most&#xD;
      important requirement for industrial adoption of any simulation method is&#xD;
      that the method must be&#xD;
      accurate enough to be `useful', essentially that it can be relied on when&#xD;
      making decisions. This has&#xD;
      always been the overriding factor in, leading provider of atomistic&#xD;
      simulation software, Accelrys'&#xD;
      choice of codes to support within its modelling environment as it has been&#xD;
      determined to maintain&#xD;
      its position at the `high quality' end of atomistic simulations. CASTEP&#xD;
      has had significant impact&#xD;
      because it predicts physical properties to an accuracy of a few percent&#xD;
      using no adjustable&#xD;
      parameters and requiring no prior information about the system, thus&#xD;
      clearly fulfilling industry and&#xD;
      Accelrys' requirements for simulation codes. Accelrys' own success can&#xD;
      also be attributed to the&#xD;
      ease of use of its products. For instance, it was the first company to&#xD;
      provide access to materials&#xD;
      simulation methodologies through a graphical user interface. CASTEP is&#xD;
      completely aligned with&#xD;
      this philosophy, being the first quantum mechanical materials simulation&#xD;
      code that truly abstracted&#xD;
      all the complexity out of the calculations to make the methodology highly&#xD;
      accessible. Given the&#xD;
      combination of accuracy, predictive capability and ease of use that CASTEP&#xD;
      provides, the final&#xD;
      factor determining the level of industrial use, as with any simulation&#xD;
      method, depends on its cost&#xD;
      effectiveness compared to other methods for obtaining the same&#xD;
      information. Continuing research&#xD;
      has significantly decreased the computational costs of CASTEP calculations&#xD;
      over and above that&#xD;
      provided by Moore's Law, thus increasing the number of tasks that are most&#xD;
      effectively assigned to&#xD;
      CASTEP. Furthermore, the continuing decrease in the cost of computation&#xD;
      means that even if a&#xD;
      simulation method is not cost effective at a particular time it is likely&#xD;
      to become so at some time in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
    Quantum mechanical simulations using CASTEP have provided the ability to&#xD;
      perform `virtual'&#xD;
      experiments on materials. However, there are many different types of&#xD;
      materials and a vast range of&#xD;
      physical, chemical and materials properties of interest involving a wide&#xD;
      range of lengthscales and&#xD;
      timescales. Therefore, simulation is not yet capable of replacing&#xD;
      experiment to determine all&#xD;
      materials properties of interest. Accelrys stresses just how much CASTEP&#xD;
      offers in solving these&#xD;
      classes of problems, by advertising the software suite as able to `simulate&#xD;
        the properties of solids,&#xD;
        interfaces, and surfaces for a wide range of materials classes,&#xD;
        including ceramics, semiconductors,&#xD;
        and metals, with this premier density functional theory (DFT) quantum&#xD;
        mechanical code'. Such&#xD;
      simulations enable customers to gain information about impurities in&#xD;
      semiconductors, optical&#xD;
      properties of materials, chemical reactions in catalysts, surface and bulk&#xD;
      diffusion, refine atomic&#xD;
      structures and generate the `experimental' spectra associated with these&#xD;
      structures.&#xD;
    The separate package CASTEP-NMR has provided is capable of generating the&#xD;
      NMR spectrum&#xD;
      associated with a model structure and thus the combination of experiment&#xD;
      and CASTEP-NMR&#xD;
      allows unambiguous determination of structures of crystals. This is&#xD;
      particularly important in the&#xD;
      pharmaceutical sector where a drug patent has to not only specify the drug&#xD;
      molecule but also the&#xD;
      crystal structure (the particular crystal polymorph) of the drug in the&#xD;
      pharmaceutical product.&#xD;
      CASTEP-NMR helps to identify the actual polymorph and, importantly,&#xD;
      deviations in experimental&#xD;
      data from that predicted. CASTEP-NMR is also used to identify low levels&#xD;
      of other polymorphs in&#xD;
      the product. If these other polymorphs are not patented then competitors&#xD;
      may circumvent the&#xD;
      patent by marketing the drug in the form of the non-patented polymorph.&#xD;
    The greatest impact of quantum mechanical simulations is often when they&#xD;
      are used alongside&#xD;
      experiment, as in the pharmaceuticals example above. For competitive&#xD;
      reasons companies tend to&#xD;
      be very secretive about their detailed use of simulation codes.&#xD;
      Illustrative examples of the&#xD;
      application of materials simulation approaches can be found in the IDC&#xD;
      report "Modeling and&#xD;
        Simulation: The Return on Investment in Materials Science," and the&#xD;
      Goldbeck Consulting report&#xD;
      "Economic Impact of Molecular Modelling". These reports mention&#xD;
      many of the societal and&#xD;
      economic benefits clearly provided by CASTEP including (i) efficiency:&#xD;
      many different properties of&#xD;
      many different classes of materials can be determined using a single piece&#xD;
      of `apparatus', namely&#xD;
      a software package and computer; (ii) the broader exploration of materials&#xD;
      solution space possible&#xD;
      once simulation becomes significantly cheaper than experiment; (iii)&#xD;
      projects which had stalled&#xD;
      were restarted with information obtained from simulation and (iv) reduced&#xD;
      time to market.&#xD;
    That CASTEP has proved to be exceedingly useful to industry is reflected&#xD;
      in its use by more than&#xD;
      800 companies and its on-going sales in excess of &amp;#163;1million every year&#xD;
      since 1998, with&#xD;
      cumulative worldwide sales now over $30million, demonstrating the value&#xD;
      placed by commercial&#xD;
      clients on access to the software. Sales over the audit period have been&#xD;
      (US$): 2008 -&#xD;
      $2,349,254, 2009 - $2,067,239, 2010 - $2,527,064, [9]. The IDC research&#xD;
      [7] suggests that the&#xD;
      return on investment in atomistic simulation is of the order of a factor&#xD;
      of 7- which implies that the&#xD;
      total economic impact of CASTEP is &amp;#163;hundreds of millions with benefits in&#xD;
      many different sectors.&#xD;
    Accelrys has expressed its confidence in the importance of the CASTEP&#xD;
      suite to the materials&#xD;
      industry. With 830 unique customers, many of whom are household names&#xD;
      (Boeing, Toyota, GM&#xD;
      and DuPont for instance), the ability to make valuable predictions about&#xD;
      new materials being used&#xD;
      in new now ways offers huge scope to diverse industries to develop their&#xD;
      product portfolio, or have&#xD;
      confidence in the use of the materials in new applications. Product&#xD;
      innovation has been enhanced&#xD;
      very substantially by CASTEP's use.&#xD;
    There are a number of published patents for materials or processes which&#xD;
      have been designed&#xD;
      partially based on CASTEP calculations. The number of distinct (i.e. not&#xD;
      counting multiple filings in&#xD;
      different regions) published patents that have used CASTEP as part of the&#xD;
      inventive process in&#xD;
      recent years are: 2008 - 12, 2009 - 5, 2010 -1, 2011 - 21, 2012 - 7 [10].&#xD;

    CASTEP is a parameter-free and predictive quantum mechanical atomistic&#xD;
      simulation code&#xD;
      developed by Professor Payne in the Department of Physics at the&#xD;
      University of Cambridge.&#xD;
      CASTEP has been sold commercially by Accelrys since 1995, with more than&#xD;
      800 industrial&#xD;
      customers using the package. As part of Accelrys' Materials Studio, it can&#xD;
      be used by non-experts&#xD;
      to determine a wide range of physical and chemical properties of&#xD;
      materials. Companies can thus&#xD;
      perform `virtual experiments' using CASTEP. As quantum mechanical&#xD;
      simulations can be cheaper&#xD;
      and more flexible than experiments, CASTEP invariably reduces costs and&#xD;
      accelerates product&#xD;
      development.&#xD;

    CASTEP is based on the so-called `total energy pseudopotential technique'&#xD;
      which uses a plane&#xD;
      wave basis set to represent the electronic wavefunctions, pseudopotentials&#xD;
      to represent the ions&#xD;
      and density functional theory to make the quantum mechanical calculations&#xD;
      tractable. Total energy&#xD;
      pseduopotential calculations had been applied to simple systems in the&#xD;
      early 1980s but were&#xD;
      restricted to small numbers of atoms from only a small part of the&#xD;
      periodic table. Progress from the&#xD;
      mid-1980s began to increase the capability of the calculations but (i)&#xD;
      only one or two chemists in&#xD;
      the world believed in density functional theory, (ii) there were concerns&#xD;
      about the applicability of&#xD;
      pseudopotentials to transition elements and (iii) it was not clear that&#xD;
      the method could address&#xD;
      complex problems. In 1991, Professor Payne (Department of Physics,&#xD;
      University of Cambridge&#xD;
      Assistant Lecturer from 1991, Professor from 2000), in collaboration with&#xD;
      Edinburgh Parallel&#xD;
      Computer Centre, ported his total energy pseudopotential code to parallel&#xD;
      computers. Subsequent&#xD;
      research exploited the increased computational performance of these&#xD;
      systems and, particularly,&#xD;
      the large amount of memory calculations that could be performed for larger&#xD;
      and more complex&#xD;
      systems. Thus, the concerns about the scope and capability of the total&#xD;
      energy pseudopotential&#xD;
      technique could be directly challenged through a series of innovative&#xD;
      scientific applications. These&#xD;
      applications not only proved that the criticisms of the total energy&#xD;
      pseudopotential techniques were&#xD;
      unfounded but also revealed the enormous scope of this approach. Amongst&#xD;
      many other&#xD;
      applications, these pioneering applications showed for the first time the&#xD;
      capability of the total&#xD;
      energy pseudopotential method to:&#xD;
    perform dynamical simulations of chemical reactions [1];&#xD;
      determine absorption energies of molecules on transition metal surfaces&#xD;
      [2];&#xD;
      model chemical reactions in extended solid state catalysts [3];&#xD;
      directly simulate experimental probes thus making a direct link between&#xD;
      experimental&#xD;
      measurements and underlying atomic structure [4].&#xD;
    By 2000 the model for developing CASTEP through a combination of academic&#xD;
      and industrial&#xD;
      inputs (some coming from companies other than Accelrys) was failing. Like&#xD;
      so many codes it had&#xD;
      become bloated and undevelopable. Between 2000 and 2003, under a major&#xD;
      research project, the&#xD;
      code was completely re-engineered from scratch by the CASTEP Developers&#xD;
      Group (CDG), with&#xD;
      most the members of CDG being based in the Department of Physics in the&#xD;
      University of&#xD;
      Cambridge during this time (see details below). The code re-engineering&#xD;
      made no re-use of&#xD;
      existing code and was carried out using modern software engineering&#xD;
      techniques to provide a&#xD;
      robust, efficient, and portable code [5]. The aim of this research project&#xD;
      was to provide a solid&#xD;
      platform for development of new capabilities and functionalities for the&#xD;
      total energy pseudopotential&#xD;
      method. One example of this was the development of a suite of Nuclear&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      capabilities and the use of this to relate experimental NMR spectra to the&#xD;
      underlying atomic&#xD;
      structure &amp;#8212; something not possible using experiment alone [6]. This&#xD;
      research led to the&#xD;
      development of an additional module CASTEP-NMR which is sold by Accelrys&#xD;
      alongside the&#xD;
      CASTEP package for those who want this additional capability.&#xD;
    Cambridge has provided the intellectual leadership for the creation and&#xD;
      development of CASTEP.&#xD;
      Throughout the relevant period the vast majority of the research&#xD;
      underpinning CASTEP code&#xD;
      development, including the key central modules, was done in Cambridge by a&#xD;
      research group led&#xD;
      by Professor Payne. Smaller contributions came from the UK Car-Parrinello&#xD;
      consortium (UKCP),&#xD;
      which also performed many applications of the code. Of the CDG, the&#xD;

      Technology Ltd, was created in 1999 (Company No. 03751674, incorporated&#xD;
      14/4/1999). The&#xD;
      university-based research provided the basis of all subsequent work in&#xD;
      Astex, including&#xD;
      approximately thirty "campaigns" against many targets, mainly of interest&#xD;
      in fighting cancer. In&#xD;
      2001 the University of Cambridge invested &amp;#163;250k and was given equity in&#xD;
      the company. The&#xD;
      company has signed deals worth in excess of $1.8bn (approximately &amp;#163;1bn)&#xD;
      between 1999 and&#xD;
      2011. Investors in Astex have included Abingworth, Apax, Oxford (Boston),&#xD;
      Advent, Alta and others&#xD;
      with &amp;#163;80 million equity in multiple financing rounds. Astex also has had&#xD;
      major collaborations with&#xD;
      investments of up to &amp;#163;25 million from each of GSK, Johnson and Johnson,&#xD;
      Novartis and&#xD;
      AstraZeneca (Ref. 1, Section 5); of these the GSK investment occurred&#xD;
      after 1/1/2008, while the&#xD;
      Johnson and Johnson, Novartis and AstraZeneca investments have continued&#xD;
      after 2008 (Ref. 2,&#xD;
      Section 5). In 2011 Astex Therapeutics was purchased by NASDAQ-listed&#xD;
      oncology company&#xD;
      SuperGen, Inc. for $150 million (ca &amp;#163;100 million). The new company was&#xD;
      named Astex&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, to reflect the strong brand name of Astex. Subsequent to&#xD;
      the impact period (ie in&#xD;
      Sept 2013) Astex was acquired by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd for $886&#xD;
      Million (ca &amp;#163;565&#xD;
      Million).&#xD;
    Jobs have been created/protected:&#xD;
      Over the past decade, the company has secured constant employment for&#xD;
      between 70 and 120&#xD;
      workers in Cambridge (Ref. 1, Section 5), the current number of employees&#xD;
      in the UK and US is&#xD;
      ~120.&#xD;
    Highly skilled people have taken up specialist roles:&#xD;
      Prof Blundell has been a member of the main Astex Board from 1999 to 2011;&#xD;
      he has chaired the&#xD;
      Astex Science Advisory Board from 1999 to the present, and he attends&#xD;
      research discussions and&#xD;
      visits Astex regularly (Ref. 1, Section 5).&#xD;
    A business or sector has adopted a new technology or process:&#xD;
      Astex changed the way that drug discovery is carried out not only within&#xD;
      its own labs but also in&#xD;
      other small companies and large pharmaceuticals. The former Head of&#xD;
      Worldwide Discovery for&#xD;
      Pfizer states: "As a consequence of Astex success, fragment-based&#xD;
      approaches are common&#xD;
      place throughout Pharma and Biotech, and the power of the technology is&#xD;
      also recognised by&#xD;
      academia and drug discovery institutes through the UK 3D Fragment&#xD;
      consortium, for example.&#xD;
      While many companies have in-house capabilities, it is perhaps telling&#xD;
      that GSK established a&#xD;
      major fragment collaboration with Astex as their internal expertise was&#xD;
      apparently not competitive.&#xD;
      Importantly, fragments may open the door to blocking protein-protein&#xD;
      interactions which would lead&#xD;
      to totally new classes of therapeutic agents designed to meet the medical&#xD;
      needs of the 21st&#xD;
      Century." (Ref. 3, Section 5)&#xD;
    Most pharmaceutical companies now use fragment-based methods in early&#xD;
      discovery. They&#xD;
      include J&amp;amp;J, GSK and Astra Zeneca, all of whom have first collaborated&#xD;
      with Astex; and GSK,&#xD;
      UCB, Heptares and Evotec, where Astex employees and/or former members of&#xD;
      the Blundell lab&#xD;
      have moved to take posts (Ref. 4, Section 5).&#xD;
    Impact on health:&#xD;
    New clinical interventions have been developed:&#xD;
      Astex has developed a strong pipeline (Ref. 5, Section 5), and three drugs&#xD;
      that were developed&#xD;
      using the fragment-based approach (AT13387, a HSP90 inhibitor, AT7519M, a&#xD;
      CDK inhibitor, and&#xD;
      AT9283, a JAK/Aurora Inhibitor) are now in Phase II clinical trials&#xD;
      for the conditions Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Stromal Tumour (NCT01294202), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (NCT01652144), Chronic&#xD;
      Lymphocytic&#xD;
      Leukemia (NCT01652144) and Multiple Myeloma (NCT01145989) ;Refs 6-9,&#xD;
      Section 5). The same&#xD;
      drugs have completed Phase I and are about to enter Phase II for other&#xD;
      related clinical conditions&#xD;
      (Multiple Myeloma (NCT01183949), Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NCT01712217),&#xD;
      and Prostate&#xD;
      Cancer (NCT01685268)), and in combination with other drugs (Refs 10-12,&#xD;
      Section 5).&#xD;
      Early discovery candidates from Astex structure-guided fragment-based drug&#xD;
      discovery are now&#xD;
      being taken forward in Phase I trials through collaborating companies,&#xD;
      include: FGFR Inhibitor JNJ&#xD;
      42756493 (NCT01703481, against Solid Tumours or Lymphoma, taken forward by&#xD;
      Janssen&#xD;
      Research &amp;amp; Development, LLC), CDK4 Inhibitor LEE011 (e.g. NCT01747876,&#xD;
      against MRT and&#xD;
      Neuroblastoma, taken forward by Novartis), PKB/Akt Inhibitor AZD 5363&#xD;
      (e.g. NCT01692262,&#xD;
      against Prostate Cancer, taken forward by Astra Zeneca) and BACE Inhibitor&#xD;
      AZD 3293 (e.g.&#xD;
      NCT01795339, against Alzheimers, taken forward by Astra Zeneca).&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    In 1999, Tom Blundell (Biochemistry), Chris Abell (Chemistry) and Harren&#xD;
      Jhoti cofounded Astex&#xD;
      Technology Ltd. to develop an X-ray structure-guided, `fragment-based'&#xD;
      approach to drug&#xD;
      discovery. This led to a significant change in how the pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry approached drug&#xD;
      discovery. Astex Technology Ltd developed four molecules in house using&#xD;
      this approach which&#xD;
      have in 2013 reached Phase I/II clinical trials for various tumours. Four&#xD;
      further molecules have&#xD;
      been taken into phase I through collaborations between Astex and Janssen,&#xD;
      Novartis and AZ. In&#xD;
      2011 the company was sold to Supergen for $150 million (ca &amp;#163;100 million),&#xD;
      creating Astex&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc., currently with ~120 employees, and a value of&#xD;
      &amp;gt;$500 million (&amp;gt;&amp;#163;320&#xD;
      million).&#xD;

    The underpinning research was conducted in collaboration between&#xD;
      Professor Sir Tom Blundell&#xD;
      (Sir William Dunn Professor of Biochemistry, Department of Biochemistry,&#xD;
      1996-2009, and now&#xD;
      Research Director) and Professor Chris Abell (Professor in Biological&#xD;
      Chemistry, since 2002;&#xD;
      Department of Chemistry; since 1984) and developed their combined&#xD;
      expertise in structural biology&#xD;
      and organic chemistry to better understand protein-ligand interactions.&#xD;
    Professor Blundell has had a long-standing interest in structure-guided&#xD;
      drug discovery and in the&#xD;
      1980s recognised the importance of characterising the 3D structure of a&#xD;
      protein target in order to&#xD;
      optimise the drug discovery process. Between his arrival at Cambridge in&#xD;
      1996 (appointed as Sir&#xD;
      William Dunn Professor of Biochemistry in 1995) and 1999, Prof Blundell&#xD;
      collaborated with various&#xD;
      pharmaceutical companies to use structure-guided crystallographic&#xD;
      approaches of enzyme-inhibitor&#xD;
      complexes to optimise new lead molecules. A study of a series of&#xD;
      non-peptidic inhibitors of&#xD;
      matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) with improved binding properties (Ref. 1,&#xD;
      Section 3) was one&#xD;
      example of structure-guided drug discovery in which the 3D structure of a&#xD;
      protein target was&#xD;
      central to optimising a "hit" compound and developing a "lead". He also&#xD;
      collaborated with Chris&#xD;
      Abell in defining crystal structures of a series of microbial proteins&#xD;
      complexed with small&#xD;
      molecules, such as the structure of E. coli aspartate&#xD;
      decarboxylase, showing an ester intermediate&#xD;
      in autocatalytic self-processing of one of the catalytic subunits (Ref. 2,&#xD;
      Section 3).&#xD;
    In 1998, Blundell and Abell, together with Dr H Jhoti (at the time&#xD;
      working at GSK), suggested a&#xD;
      novel approach, which underpinned the formation in May 1999 of the spinout&#xD;
      company Astex&#xD;
      Technology. The approach was to develop novel therapeutics from very small&#xD;
      chemical fragments&#xD;
      (MW&amp;lt;300) using high-throughput methods with powerful X-ray sources,&#xD;
      together with roboticised&#xD;
      data collection, to define at high-resolution complexes of small molecules&#xD;
      (fragments). They&#xD;
      hypothesised that a library of 300-1,000 small fragments could explore&#xD;
      chemical space more&#xD;
      efficiently than a million-compound library of larger drug like molecules.&#xD;
      The approach, known as&#xD;
      fragment-based drug discovery, depended on identifying the positions of&#xD;
      fragments bound to the&#xD;
      protein by X-ray crystallography and then using knowledge of their&#xD;
      positions and the structure of&#xD;
      the targets to elaborate these.&#xD;
    Research in the laboratories of Blundell and Abell was funded in the&#xD;
      University during 1999-2000&#xD;
      by a grant from Abingworth Ventures via Astex Technology. The research was&#xD;
      carried out by two&#xD;
      post-doctoral researchers in the Blundell group (Department of&#xD;
      Biochemistry; Dr Emil Parasini and&#xD;
      Dr Anne Cleasby), in collaboration with a post-doctoral researcher in the&#xD;
      Abell group (Department&#xD;
      of Chemistry; Dr Martyn Frederickson). Multiple crystals of target&#xD;
      proteins (e.g. renin, trypsin) were&#xD;
      screened with a small fragment library (including peptides, and molecules&#xD;
      such as benzamidine, 4-aminopyridine,&#xD;
      cyclohexylamine, histamine, 2-aminoimidazole, 4-aminoimidazole, proflavin,&#xD;
      4-guanidinobutyric&#xD;
      acid and cycloheptamine) in 1999. They demonstrated in 1999-2000 that&#xD;
      binding&#xD;
      of very small molecules (MW less than 300) could be detected and their&#xD;
      positions, including&#xD;
      orientation, defined at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. Due to&#xD;
      their commercial sensitivity&#xD;
      these results were not published until 2002 (Refs 3 and 4, Section 3). In&#xD;
      these papers, Blundell and&#xD;
      Abell describe the concept of X-ray structure-based fragment screening,&#xD;
      and the linking and&#xD;
      "growing" of fragments across the binding site using X-ray structures as&#xD;
      guides (e.g. Figure 3, Ref.&#xD;
      4, Section 3). The significance of their results enabled Blundell, Abell&#xD;
      and Jhoti to raise substantial&#xD;
      further funding and develop the spinout company Astex Technology Ltd.&#xD;

    The UltraMill machine was developed to support the engagement of UK and
      European manufacturing SMEs in high value manufacturing, particularly in
      ultra-precision and micro manufacturing. UPM Ltd., who built the first
      machine with Brunel University in 2008, have sold the licence for the
      commercialisation and manufacturing rights to ITP Ltd for a 2% share of
      the sales of the machine.
	 
     Figure 1 UltraMill
     
     In early 2013 ITP manufactured the first batch of 3 machines and sold
      them to Germany (Sonplas GmbH), China and the UK. Sonplas
        GmbH(Germany) is a leading international manufacturer of fuel
      injection devices, who purchased their UltraMill to manufacture new
      injectors for diesel engines.
    The development of the UltraMill has created economic, technological and
      employment benefits up and down the supply chain. In particular, a number
      of UK manufacturing companies have benefited from the UltraMill by
      supplying parts and components for its manufacture. These include
      Renishaw, who supplied the encoders, Delta Tau UK (the controllers) and
      Spar-Tec Industries Ltd (the machine guard).
     During the development of the UltraMIll, a number of industrial companies
      benefited from ultra-precision machining services. These included Contour
      Fine Tooling (2008), Rainford (2010) in the UK, and Aplix 2008/9. Contour
      Fine Tooling (CFT) leads the worldwide market in diamond cutting tools,
      holding 30% of the market share. Before they had become known for their
      cutting-edge diamond cutting tools, they manufactured and sold diamond
      turning tools. However, inspired by the concept of the UltraMill, they
      developed the first diamond micro-milling tool in the world, using the
      UltraMill as a test-bed to demonstrate the feasibility of their prototype
      before introducing it to the market.
	
     Figure 2 iPhone 5S
       
    CFT successfully marketed the diamond micro-milling tools; following
      their lead, diamond micro-milling technologies are now available from 4
      companies in the world.
    CFT's diamond micro-milling technology has been used for the bevelled
      edges of the iPhone 5S. 23 million units of the iPhone 5S were sold since
      its release and Apple currently manufacture 150,000 units per day. (Daily
      Mail 15 Oct 2013)
    Following on from the UltraMill, TSB-funded research and development
      helped build a new smart cutting tool, which can monitor the micro-milling
      process by measuring the cutting forces in real time. This tool contains a
      number of technological innovations and has attracted commercialisation
      interest from Renishaw. Two international patents have been granted on the
      design of the tool (August 2013) and the magnetic squeeze film damper for
      air bearings (January 2008).
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The UltraMill machine was developed at Brunel University in 2008, in
      collaboration with Ultra Precision Motion (UPM) Ltd, to help support UK
      and European manufacturing SMEs in high value manufacturing sectors,
      particularly in ultra-precision and micro manufacturing. The machine has a
      novel design and the sub-systems and machine elements have a number of
      technological innovations. Two international patents have been granted to
      protect the IP within the machine. A surface roughness of 4-6 nm was
      micro-milled on non-ferrous metal components by the UltraMill in 2008,
      which at the time was the finest engineering surface achieved by
      ultra-precision micro-milling in the world.
    A licence agreement was signed with ITP Group (UK) in 2012 for the
      commercial production of the UltraMill. This was ITP's first entry into
      the high-precision milling market. ITP realigned their production systems
      to begin manufacturing the UltraMill in late 2012 and have manufactured 3
      machines to date.
    Contour Fine Tooling, which leads the worldwide market in the field of
      diamond cutting tools, was inspired by the UltraMill, and developed the
      first diamond micro-milling tool in the world. The UltraMill was used to
      test the tool's capabilities and feasibility; the new tool has since been
      successfully sold. It is now being used to manufacture a number of
      high-value products. In particular it is used by Apple to produce the
      bevelled edges of the iPhone 5S. Apple currently manufactures 150,000
      iPhone 5S units per day.

    The development of the UltraMIll machine had led to substantial
      commercial and business benefits to the industrial companies in the joint
      machine development and the machine building supply chain. For instance,
      this is well evidenced by the strong claims by two industrial partner
      companies (UPM Ltd and Delta Tau UK Ltd) at their websites:

    Ultra-precision Micro Milling for High Value Manufacturing
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>General Engineering</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    The UltraMill machine was developed through the EU FP6 MASMICRO
      Integrated Project (2004-2008), to help support UK and European
      manufacturing SMEs in high-value manufacturing sectors, particularly in
      ultra-precision and micro manufacturing. Substantial research was
      undertaken by Professor Kai Cheng and his team in Advanced Manufacturing
      and Enterprise Engineering (AMEE) at Brunel University during the machine
      research and development phase, and further commercial exploration
      occurred particularly in the period of 2008-2012 [1][2][3].
    The UltraMill is a bench-top micro-milling machine designed and built to
      perform the milling, drilling and grinding of a wide range of miniature
      components as well as fine surface features on components of up to
      150x150x80 mm in size. Its unique construction, using air bearings and
      direct drives on all axes, means that it can achieve outstanding
      dimensional precision, surface geometry and the finest surface roughness.
      This is achieved by the machine's multi-scale simulation-based design and
      analysis, combined with its novel design structure, with sub-systems and
      elements that incorporate a number of technological innovations.
    Machining trials on soft metal substrates produced surface finishes down
      to 10 nm Ra, with surface flatness or straightness better than 0.1 03bcm
      over 50 mm of travel and repeatability of less than 1 &amp;amp;mum, making it
      suitable for the machining of complex optical components or their moulds
      [4][5].
    The UltraMill machine has the following further special technical
      features and capabilities, developed through the underpinning research and
      development at Brunel University:
    
      Aerostatic bearings incorporating squeeze film dampers and direct
        drive motors on all linear and one rotational axes so as to achieve
        smooth motion with exceptional accuracy and excellent dynamic
        performance;
      High speed aerostatic spindles capable of 200,000 rpm offering the
        highest machining efficiency for micro milling;
      PC based CNC control system with Windows platform and customizable HMI
        and bespoke micro milling capability;
      Optional extras include a robot-based tool/workpiece change and
        inspection subsystem and a condition monitoring subsystem.
    
    Applications of the UltraMill machine include high precision mould tools,
      optical components, medical devices, transducers, watch components, micro
      printed circuit boards, electronic components and tribological components

    The research of the Humphreys' group has had impact on three companies: Forge
        Europa Ltd, AIXTRON Ltd and Plessey Semiconductors Ltd.
    The impact on Forge Europa has been from the Humphreys' group
      research on LED reliability, &amp;amp; it was highlighted in the EPSRC Annual
      Report 2010-2011 [1] under the heading "Economic Success for Gallium
      Nitride LEDs": "Professor Sir Colin Humphreys and his team at Cambridge
      University... have delivered positive outcomes for businesses in the
      lighting industry... For example, Forge Europa, an SME in Cumbria...
      received the Queens Award for Innovation in 2009. Its Managing Director
      Peter Barton writes, `The excellent work of the Cambridge group has
        proved to be of great benefit to Forge Europa and assisted our business
        to grow by over 100% in a 3-year period... A great deal of our knowledge
        is directly attributed to our links with Cambridge.'..." Of the
      impact on AIXTRON, its Managing Director, Tony Pearce (in October
      2013), writes "Our collaboration with Professor Humphreys' group in
        Cambridge has been hugely valuable to AIXTRON. The research carried out
        by the Cambridge group not only advances understanding of the material
        technology, but helps us build deposition systems to meet these demands.
        AIXTRON remains in a dominant position, with significant revenues
        generated by this technology of [text removed for publication]. Furthermore,
        AIXTRON continues to develop next-generation products that will serve
        the future semiconductor material challenges, and our collaboration with
        the team at the University of Cambridge will continue to help us steer
        this technology."
    Humphreys &amp;amp; two colleagues (Dandan Zhu &amp;amp; Lewis Liu) set up
      spin-offs to exploit their research, CamGaN in 2010 &amp;amp; Intellec
      in 2011, to which UCAM transferred the patent noted in Sections 2 &amp;amp; 3,
      that provides a framework for a considerable amount of know-how that was
      deliberately not patented. The patent &amp;amp; know-how provide a method for
      growing low-cost high-efficiency GaN LEDs on 6-inch Si. Plessey
      acquired CamGaN &amp;amp; Intellec in February 2012 for [text
      removed for publication] &amp;amp; hired Zhu &amp;amp; Liu (Fig. 1), &amp;amp; another
      Humphreys group member, David Wallis. Plessey raised funds to permit this
      acquisition of patent &amp;amp; know-how, to purchase a commercial-scale GaN
      growth reactor from AIXTRON &amp;amp; other equipment, &amp;amp; to revive
      a mothballed 6-inch Si processing line in its factory in Plymouth. Zhu
      &amp;amp; Wallis successfully transferred the UCAM recipe for growing GaN LED
      structures to the new reactor at Plessey in December 2012. This
      has enabled Plessey to sustain ~12 manufacturing jobs, &amp;amp; it is
      currently in the process of hiring additional staff to support the
      production of GaN LEDs on 6-inch Si. Plessey is addressing a
      global market: this is a clear indication of the cost savings the UCAM
      technology brings. The LEDs are already on the market (Fig. 2; product
      data sheet at: [www.plesseysemiconductors.com/doc/?id=292040]).
      Sales of [text removed for publication]. Until now, all the LEDs in the UK
      are manufactured in China or Taiwan. Plessey has recently raised
      additional funding to purchase nine more commercial-size GaN growth
      reactors.

      and Skills, visits Plessey (15 April 2013) and hears about the
      GaN-on-silicon technology from Lewis Liu.

      site Saelig Co Inc. [http://www.saelig.com/pr/plw111010.html]

    The impact of Humphreys' group research on Plessey has been
      highlighted in: Inside: Technology [2]; The Economist [3];
      &amp;amp; Ingenia [4]. The Economist [3] states: "Plessey's
      other big venture is light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for lighting homes and
      offices... Plessey is up against mighty competitors like GE, Philips,
      Samsung and Siemens. Mr LeGoff (Managing Director, Plessey) says Plessey
      has an edge. It can make LED lights at a fraction of the cost of rivals,
      thanks to a unique process developed at Cambridge University."
    David Willetts, the Universities &amp;amp; Science Minister, writes in Eight
        Great Technologies [5]: "The team led by Professor Sir Colin
      Humphreys at Cambridge has developed a new cost-effective way of growing
      gallium nitride on silicon, which in turn increases the cost effectiveness
      and energy efficiency of LED lighting. Since lighting accounts for today
      20% of all electricity generated in the UK, widespread adoption of LED
      lighting would reduce electricity consumption by 10-15%. And moreover,
      these are being manufactured in the UK (using the technology) by Plessey.
      Plessey acquired this technology in 2012 and plan to produce 500 million
      LEDs a year in Plymouth &amp;#8212; the first manufacturer of LEDs in the UK".
    Electronics Weekly [6] states: "Plessey got into white LEDs by
      buying University of Cambridge GaN-on-Si spin-out CamGaN... this
      is the first production of GaN-on-Si LEDs from any company, and Plessey
      has gone from never having made an LED to manufacturing with this advanced
      technology in 15 months."
    The research of the Humphreys' group has revolutionized the
        manufacturing of low-cost high-efficiency LEDs and we expect that the
        impact of this work will continue to grow.
    Main types of impact
    Economic &amp;#8212; Performance of existing business improved
      through new products &amp;amp; processes (Plessey, establishing the
      UK's first manufacture of LEDs); Spin-out business created (CamGaN
      &amp;amp; Intellec, now bought by Plessey with financial benefit for
      UCAM &amp;amp; the inventors); Business sector adopted new or
        significantly changed technology or process (AIXTRON, market
      leader through innovation in GaN-growth technologies); Performance
        improved through highly skilled people taking up specialist roles that
        draw on their research (members of Humphreys' group joining AIXTRON,
      Forge Europa and Plessey).
    Society &amp;#8212; Research has contributed to community regeneration
      (Forge Europa investment, creating jobs in Cumbria; Plessey
      investment, sustaining &amp;amp; creating jobs in Devon).
    Environment &amp;#8212; Improved through introduction of new products or
        processes (much broader use of LED lighting will significantly
      reduce electricity consumption &amp;amp; CO2 emissions).
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research on the growth of gallium nitride (GaN) light-emitting diode
      (LED) structures has led to the creation of two spin-out businesses
      (subsequently sold), has assisted Forge Europa Ltd in expanding
      its sales of LED-lighting products, has helped AIXTRON to achieve
      sales of related GaN-growth equipment [text removed for publication],
      &amp;amp; has enabled Plessey Semiconductors Ltd to manufacture the
      world's first commercially available LEDs on 6-inch Si (&amp;amp; the first
      LEDs to be manufactured in the UK).

    Sir Colin Humphreys, Professor in the Dept of Materials
        Science &amp;amp; Metallurgy (DMSM) at the University of Cambridge (UCAM)
        since 1990, has a long record of research (grants listed in Section
      3) on GaN LEDs, in which the light-emitting layers are quantum wells (QWs)
      of InGaN sandwiched between GaN barriers. The QWs emit blue light &amp;amp; a
      covering phosphor converts this to white. Bright emission is obtained for
      dislocation densities as high as 109 cm-2, while for
      all other light-emitting semiconductors the dislocation density has to be
      less than 103 cm-2, or dislocations, as
      non-radiative recombination centres, quench light emission. It was thought
      that nm-sized In-rich clusters in the QWs localized the carriers
      (electrons &amp;amp; holes) &amp;amp; prevented them from diffusing to the
      dislocations. Such clusters, observed in electron microscopy, were shown
      by Humphreys' group to be an artefact of electron-beam damage [1],
      changing the accepted understanding of why GaN LEDs are so efficient with
      high dislocation densities, &amp;amp; underpinning the group's subsequent work
      on high-efficiency GaN LEDs.
    In collaboration with Manchester University (performing optical studies),
      Humphreys' group showed that carriers in the InGaN quantum wells are
      localized within a few nanometres, &amp;amp; suggested a localization
      mechanism [2]: monolayer-height QW thickness fluctuations, which the group
      observed in high-resolution electron microscopy in device structures grown
      in DMSM.
    Although the efficiency of GaN LEDs is not highly sensitive to the
      dislocation density, the efficiency is reduced if the dislocation density
      is very high. To study this, Humphreys' group invented a novel, fast
      method for assessing dislocation densities in GaN [3], followed by a
      breakthrough [4] on how to reduce the dislocation density of GaN grown on
      sapphire, using porous silicon nitride interlayers. The group was able to
      transfer this method to growth of GaN LEDs on 6-inch Si substrates &amp;#8212; very
      difficult, compared to growth on smaller-diameter sapphire or SiC
      substrates. The large (54%) difference in the thermal expansion
      coefficients of GaN &amp;amp; Si leads to wafer bowing on cooling from the
      growth temperature (~1000&amp;#176;C); the GaN is in tension &amp;amp; cracks.
      Humphreys' group inserted four graded AlGaN layers, carefully tailored so
      that their compressive stress compensates the tensile stress upon cooling,
      crucially ending with a flat, crack-free LED. The large (17%) lattice
      mismatch between GaN &amp;amp; Si would result in an unacceptably high
      dislocation density, &amp;amp; Humphreys' group solved this problem using a
      sub-monolayer SiN mask with natural holes; epitaxial lateral overgrowth
      from these reduces the dislocation density by two orders of magnitude.
    To protect know-how, only a little (eg [5] &amp;amp; a patent pending [6])
      has so far been published on the commercially important processing to
      achieve GaN LED growth on 6-inch Si.

    NiTech Solutions Ltd was spun off from Heriot-Watt University in Dec
      2004, aided by a SMART
      award from Scottish Enterprise, with plug-flow crystallisation and
      reaction as the key technologies
      for chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. A second SMART award on
      continuous
      crystallisation supported Dr Anting Liao, Xiongwei Ni's ex-PhD student
      from HWU, to be employed
      at NiTech to carry out the designed trials. Excellent results were
      generated; for example,
      consistent crystal morphology/size distribution/enhanced yield,
      significantly reduced process time
      and waste, and elimination of the use of milling machines. An example of
      the impact of the
      technology is the continuous crystallisation of one of the AstraZeneca's
      blockbuster drug
      ingredients. In their operation in traditional crystallisers, it takes 9
      hours and 40 minutes for the
      crystallisation step; the filtration rate is poor because of uneven sizes
      of crystals generated due to
      the difficulties, identified above, of controlling the crystallisation
      environment. In order to obtain the
      required size a milling machine is used as one of the key downstream unit
      operations. When
      applying NiTech continuous crystallising technology, the overall process
      was shown to take only 12
      minutes with uniform sizes, enhanced filtration rates (which eliminate the
      use of the milling
      machine) and significant savings in capital and operational costs (see ref
      [6] above).
    Another leading example is the production of a biopharmaceutical drug in
      Genzyme (now Sanofi).
      In less than two years from conception in 2005, full production was
      commissioned at the Haverhill
      site in April 2007 after successful trials and design at NiTech as well as
      the certification of the
      process by the FDA. NiTech technology was used to launch production of a
      new active
      pharmaceutical ingredient (API) via a three-phase reaction on the scale of
      multi-hundred tons p.a.
      with a value of multi-&amp;#163;100M p.a. The reaction is approximately 40 times
      faster than a batch
      process, with good flexibility to control throughput. The reactor was able
      to fit into a small footprint
      in an existing building, avoiding the traditional alternative of two large
      pressure reactors and a new
      building. There was a resultant saving of several million pounds in
      capital expenditure and
      approximately four times faster construction. Simplicity of operation and
      reduced maintenance
      costs have been sustained. Product quality is higher, with the ability to
      continuously monitor and
      control the reaction leading to a zero reject rate for this reaction step,
      all contributing to a
      competitive commercial advantage. Quoting a Senior Manager of Genzyme:
    "This is believed to be the largest scale continuous manufacturing
        plant for a patented API in the
        world. Importantly, we were able to supply the market many months
        earlier than would have been
        the case with conventional batch processing. This was one of the best
        investment decisions that I
        have made! "

    NiTech has filed key patents on continuous crystallisation, worked with a
      large number of chemical,
      food and pharmaceutical companies on continuous crystallisation, including
      seven out of the top
      ten global pharma giants and two out of the top three global food
      companies on edible oils. It has
      received investments over &amp;#163;3M and employed more than 16 people.
    Following discussions between NiTech, GSK, and members of the ScotCHEM
      research pooling
      and Chemical Sciences Scotland industry-academia collaborative initiatives
      on how to further
      exploit this technology, a joint demonstration project was established in
      mid-2009. GSK provided
      `model' crystallisation process and materials. Outstanding results were
      obtained in these trials. It
      was seen as an opportunity for Scotland to take the lead in meeting the
      challenges facing chemical
      manufacturing globally. This led to continuous crystallisation being the
      platform technology in the
      GSK-led Continuous Manufacture and Crystallisation (CMAC) consortium. CMAC
      was established
      in 2010 with &amp;#163;1M cash injection and &amp;#163;1M in kind each from GSK,
      AstraZeneca and Novartis as the
      tier-one members, plus &amp;#163;250k from tier two members including Fujifilm,
      Genzyme, Croda,
      Syngenta, Evonik, NiTech itself and others. In 2010/11, NiTech changed its
      business model to
      become an integrator and facilitator, focussing on collaboration with an
      engineering company
      rather than manufacturing the reactors itself. It is a critical part of
      CMAC, indeed, according to a
      member of the Board
    "NiTech's technology is the technology that started it all off".
    CMAC has now grown into a &amp;gt;&amp;#163;60M consortium with research grants from
      EPSRC Centre for
      Innovative Manufacturing (&amp;#163;9.1M), ESPRC DTC (&amp;#163;6.9M), Scottish Funding
      Council (&amp;#163;1.5M), TSB
      (1.75M), EPSRC ICT Platform (&amp;#163;4M), EU (&amp;#163;0.5M), and EPSRC RPIF (&amp;#163;34M). CMAC
      is now the
      largest and the most comprehensive centre in the world on continuous
      crystallisation. It is focused
      on helping industry to evaluate and trial leading edge process solutions
      against their requirements
      and to accelerate the introduction of new process-intensification
      technologies to meet wider
      industry needs.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research at Heriot-Watt University (HWU) has led to the development of a
      new continuous
      oscillatory baffled reactor and crystalliser technology. This has direct
      economic and environmental
      impact in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. Waste is
      substantially reduced, while
      the scale of the equipment and plant is dramatically decreased, reducing
      time to market, start-up
      and maintenance costs and on-going energy usage. The reactor/crystalliser
      was taken to market
      through a spinout, NiTech Solutions Ltd, with a peak of 16 employees in
      the REF period. Genzyme
      (now Sanofi) has implemented NiTech's technology for biopharmaceutical
      manufacture since
      2007, with multi-100 ton production and sales of multi-&amp;#163;100M pa. The
      technology now underpins
      the larger-scale joint venture, the Continuous Manufacture and
      Crystallisation (CMAC) consortium,
      launched in 2010. CMAC has attracted over &amp;#163;60M investment, much of it from
      three major
      industrial partners, GSK, AstraZeneca and Novartis, with additional
      second-tier investors. CMAC is
      accelerating the introduction of new process-intensification technologies
      in the process industries.

    Traditional batch technologies for manufacture of fine chemicals are
      inherently inefficient due to
      the difficulties of consistently meeting product specifications. This
      incurs significant financial
      penalties and generates waste. The current norm is that for every 1 kg of
      active pharmaceutical
      ingredient (API) harvested, 50 to 200 kg of waste is produced. The typical
      raw material cost for a
      single batch of API is &amp;#163;1 to &amp;#163;5M. Many of these products (over 90% of
      pharmaceuticals and 80%
      of fine chemicals) are of crystalline form and involve a crystallisation
      step in their production cycle.
      The control of crystal purity, morphology and size distribution therefore
      has a significant impact on
      the efficiency and profitability of the overall production.
    Research of Prof Xiongwei Ni at Heriot-Watt University has successfully
      addressed the
      underpinning physical principles that are responsible for these
      limitations of traditional batch
      reactors and crystallisers. The work was stimulated, in part, by the
      results of a 9-year EPSRC-
      funded project (part of which was carried out at HWU) `Chemicals Behaving
      Badly'. This identified
      that the key to delivering consistent product specifications included the
      control of cooling (linear)
      profile and the attainment of uniform mixing. However, neither of these
      features is achievable in
      industrial batch systems, due to the facts that mixing becomes less
      efficient and the specific area
      per unit volume for heat transfer decreases dramatically with scale. This
      makes any controlled
      cooling profiles problematic to implement in any industrial production.
    Ni's research has focused on understanding the science of achieving
      uniform mixing at all scales in
      plug flow under laminar flow conditions1, 2 The
      continuous oscillatory baffled reactor and crystalliser
      technology developed as a result of this research combines both uniform
      mixing with precise
      temperature control, allowing any desired cooling profiles, e.g. linear,
      nonlinear, step function,
      parabolic, etc., to be achieved from lab to full scales. The applicability
      of the technology has been
      demonstrated for transport processes, reactions and crystallisation.3, 4
	  Major patents have been
      filed on both apparatus and method.5 The technology eliminates
      the two fundamental problems
      encountered in traditional industrial scale crystallisers identified
      above. It also enables kinetic
      reaction time to be executed at all scales, shrinking the space required.
      Unlike standard batch
      systems, laboratory monitoring tools have been shown to be capable of
      being implemented on
      industrial scales without modification, facilitating smooth, direct and
      fast transition from the
      laboratory to production. Knowledge gained in the laboratory can be
      applied directly in production,
      again unlike in traditional full-scale operations due to the effects of
      non-scalable mixing.
    Trials with a large number of chemical, food and pharmaceutical compounds
      (&amp;gt;60) from various
      industrial companies have firmly reinforced that the technology delivers
      consistent product quality,
      e.g. size distribution, morphology, yield and purity, with significant
      reductions (&amp;gt;90%) in process
      time, waste and unwanted products, as well as in energy, utility, plant
      size and inventory.6
      Continuous reaction and crystallisation are now identified as critical
      steps in process-intensification
      drives to improve manufacturing in the chemical and pharmaceutical
      industries, through more
      efficient use of reagents, solvents and energy while minimizing side
      reactions, unwanted products
      and waste materials.

    Since its formation ForthDD (originally Micropix) has raised in excess of&#xD;
      $33M in investment&#xD;
      including the 2011 injection of $11M by leading US microdisplay company,&#xD;
      Kopin Corporation [S5].&#xD;
      Headquartered in Fife, Scotland, ForthDD has maintained and continues to&#xD;
      maintain strong&#xD;
      technical links with the ERPE research team. ForthDD designs, develops and&#xD;
      manufactures single&#xD;
      chip micro-displays used in the most demanding segments of markets such as&#xD;
      training and&#xD;
      simulation systems, HD video camera viewfinders, medical imaging systems&#xD;
      and virtual-reality and&#xD;
      head-mounted displays [S5]. Entirely digital, providing 24-bit full-colour&#xD;
      images, capable of&#xD;
      handling high-speed motion and with no visible artefacts, ForthDD's single&#xD;
      chip imagers are&#xD;
      especially well-matched to the new solid state LED and laser diode light&#xD;
      sources and provide very&#xD;
      high native resolution. ForthDD now has offices in Spain, Germany and the&#xD;
      USA.&#xD;
    In late 2012, ForthDD reaffirmed its position as the world's leading&#xD;
      supplier of advanced&#xD;
      microdisplays when it released the world's highest resolution full colour&#xD;
      microdisplay [S1].&#xD;
      Underwood was employed as a consultant in the feasibility stage of&#xD;
      defining the new product.&#xD;
      "ForthDD's premium quality components are deployed and used in the most&#xD;
        demanding systems&#xD;
        and applications imaginable. Forth Dimension Displays' product range&#xD;
        has, from the beginning,&#xD;
        been targeted at high-end markets. In these applications, image quality&#xD;
        is of the utmost&#xD;
        importance. The ability to provide colour has always been absolutely&#xD;
        essential throughout our&#xD;
        product range and the pioneering research done at ERPE on field&#xD;
        sequential colour, using&#xD;
        switched LED illumination, provided the foundation for our products to&#xD;
        produce deep, saturated,&#xD;
        satisfying colour." CEO, ForthDD [S2].&#xD;
    The Near-To-Eye displays market comprises Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs)&#xD;
      and Electronic&#xD;
      Viewfinders (EVFs). While other companies and other divisions of Kopin&#xD;
      address the mainstream,&#xD;
      the Unique Selling Point (USP) of ForthDD is that its products achieve the&#xD;
      highest image quality&#xD;
      available in LCoS microdisplays and can thus command a high price from&#xD;
      those customers with&#xD;
      the most demanding applications. The foundations of the ability to meet&#xD;
      the requirements of the&#xD;
      most demanding applications lies in the research carried out by ERPE: "A&#xD;
        key selling point for&#xD;
        Forth Dimension Displays is our ability to produce high quality images&#xD;
        in applications where competing&#xD;
        technologies do not quite make the grade. Underpinning this image&#xD;
        quality are product features&#xD;
        enabled by technical specifications such as high pixel aperture ratio&#xD;
        and accurate liquid crystal&#xD;
        alignment, that were first established through the ERPE research on&#xD;
        backplane surface quality&#xD;
        improvement. The backplane surface quality improvement techniques&#xD;
        described by the ERPE research&#xD;
        have been adopted by CMOS foundries, such as those from which ForthDD&#xD;
        obtains the substrates for&#xD;
        its current product range." Director of Product Design, ForthDD&#xD;
      [S3].&#xD;
    Achieving colour with pulsed RGB LED illumination.&#xD;
    The combined fast switching capability of digital CMOS active matrix&#xD;
      drivers and Binary&#xD;
      Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal allowed the achievement of colour images by&#xD;
      using fast pulses from&#xD;
      Red, Green and Blue (RGB) LEDs to create the illusion of full colour&#xD;
      images without colour filters&#xD;
      and with no spatial separation of RGB sub-pixels. It also allowed an&#xD;
      all-digital video signal path.&#xD;
      This ERPE research [2, 3], was quickly incorporated into early products&#xD;
      and has been continually&#xD;
      developed and refined within the company to encompass higher colour depth,&#xD;
      higher frame rates&#xD;
      and higher definition. "Thus every Forth Dimension Displays product,&#xD;
        including the most recent&#xD;
        product range, the QXGA (2048 x 1536 pixel) microdisplay launched in&#xD;
        October 2012, has used&#xD;
        and continues to use pulsed RGB LED illumination based upon the original&#xD;
        ERPE scheme that&#xD;
        was published [2, 3] as an outcome of the foundational ERPE research."&#xD;
      CEO, ForthDD [S2]&#xD;
    Improving image quality through improved manufacturing techniques&#xD;
    The improvements in surface planarity and pixel fill factor achieved by&#xD;
      ERPE researchers [4, 5],&#xD;
      were critical to allowing FLCoS microdisplays to exceed the threshold of&#xD;
      image quality necessary&#xD;
      to satisfy customers. The underlying manufacturing processes were made&#xD;
      available to ForthDD's&#xD;
      commercial CMOS foundry supplier, through publication and direct transfer,&#xD;
      and thus were&#xD;
      incorporated into product manufacture. The CMOS foundry has continued to&#xD;
      refine these. Thus the&#xD;
      manufacturability, image quality and optical efficiency of the current&#xD;
      product range and the recently&#xD;
      released product range rely upon the ERPE foundational research in&#xD;
      manufacturing techniques&#xD;
      pioneered in the Scottish Microelectronics Centre.&#xD;
    Infrastructure for the design and characterisation of the technology&#xD;
    The development of infrastructure linking the design and&#xD;
      manufacturability of FLCoS microdisplays&#xD;
      (such as the developed SPICE model for the FLC [6]) assisted the&#xD;
      productisation of the&#xD;
      technology. "GarField Matrics is the integrated circuit design&#xD;
        subcontractor to ForthDD. ERPE&#xD;
        researchers have made many successful technical advances to the design&#xD;
        of FLCoS&#xD;
        microdisplays. Specifically they developed a SPICE simulation model to&#xD;
        represent the electrical&#xD;
        load that the ferroelectric liquid crystal places on the drive circuit.&#xD;
        It is essential to have SPICE&#xD;
        models of components that are both robust and accurate. Thus the ERPE&#xD;
        SPICE models have&#xD;
        been used directly in the design of FLCoS active matrix backplanes. Thus&#xD;
        the design-flow for new&#xD;
        products has benefited directly from the ERPE research on design and&#xD;
        characterisation."&#xD;
      Managing Director, GarField Matrics [S4].&#xD;
    The electronic architecture and pixel drive circuit of every product&#xD;
      generation designed by ForthDD&#xD;
      have been based upon architectures and designs first pioneered by ERPE&#xD;
      researchers. Thus the&#xD;
      prosperity of the company is comprehensively underpinned by ERPE research.&#xD;
      And that prosperity&#xD;
      is evident in that, today, ForthDD is the division of Kopin Corporation &amp;#8212;&#xD;
      the world's largest&#xD;
      microdisplay company &amp;#8212; whose products address the most demanding markets&#xD;
      such as electronic&#xD;
      viewfinders for professional cinematography cameras plus commercial and&#xD;
      military flight simulators&#xD;
      (97% of military flight simulators based on head-mounted displays use&#xD;
      ForthDD microdisplays.&#xD;
      Customers in these markets include Rockwell Collins, ARRI and L-3&#xD;
      Communications). Current&#xD;
      products are focused on Virtual Reality [S6] for consumer applications.&#xD;
    "ForthDD develops and manufactures the world's highest performance&#xD;

    Introduction.&#xD;
    Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) spatial light modulators (SLMs) were&#xD;
      conceived then researched&#xD;
      and developed within ERPE and the School of Physics. The team developed&#xD;
      high performance&#xD;
      Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal on Silicon (FLCoS) SLMs in the late 1980s and&#xD;
      early 1990s and&#xD;
      deployed them in a range of applications with primarily industrial&#xD;
      collaborators. [1] reports the state&#xD;
      of the art of LCoS technology around 1993. Around that time it became&#xD;
      clear that a major application&#xD;
      for FLCoS SLMs was as miniature active-matrix liquid crystal displays&#xD;
      (also called microdisplays) to&#xD;
      be viewed under optical magnification in electronic projection systems and&#xD;
      head-mounted display-systems.&#xD;
    The most important underpinning ERPE research contributions were:&#xD;
    Achieving colour without colour filters by pulsed illumination of red,&#xD;
        green and blue LEDs.&#xD;
    To be successful in mainstream applications, a display technology must be&#xD;
      capable of producing&#xD;
      moving colour images. The first LCoS SLM-based microdisplays used&#xD;
      single-colour LED illumination&#xD;
      and so produced monochrome images. In 1996 a method for producing 3-bit&#xD;
      colour images on a low&#xD;
      resolution microdisplay using short rapid pulses of illumination from red,&#xD;
      green and blue LEDs in&#xD;
      sequence [2] was reported. The method was refined to produce 16-bit colour&#xD;
      and high resolution [3]&#xD;
      via the DTI-LINK project SLIMDIS (1995-7; ca &amp;#163;200k; with ERPE, GEC&#xD;
      Marconi, Swindon Silicon&#xD;
      Systems, Admit Design Systems, Davin Optical Holdings).&#xD;
    Improving image quality through improved manufacturing techniques.&#xD;
    Image quality is one of the most important factors in determining the&#xD;
      competitiveness of a new&#xD;
      display technology. Certainly a minimum level of image quality is&#xD;
      essential. In the case of LCoS&#xD;
      displays, the optical quality of the surface of the CMOS (active matrix)&#xD;
      substrate has a huge&#xD;
      influence on the perceived image quality. In the late 1990s this was the&#xD;
      main topic of the EPSRC-funded&#xD;
      PACMAN project (1998 - 2001; ca &amp;#163;800k; led by Underwood with Micropix,&#xD;
      CRL, Admit&#xD;
      Design Systems). [4] reported techniques to planarise the substrate at the&#xD;
      pixel-array level (i.e.,&#xD;
      reduce excess curvature that can lead to colour artefacts). While [5]&#xD;
      reports detailed process&#xD;
      characterisation and optimisation to planarise the substrate at the&#xD;
      sub-pixel level by filling narrow&#xD;
      trenches in the substrate that, if unfilled, would adversely affect the&#xD;
      alignment of the LC and,&#xD;
      hereby, the image quality.&#xD;
    Infrastructure for the design and characterisation of the technology.&#xD;
    A robust generic infrastructure for the design and characterisation of&#xD;
      FLCoS microdisplays was an&#xD;
      essential part of the industrialisation of the technology. This&#xD;
      requirement was addressed in the&#xD;
      EPSRC-funded ELITE project (1999-2001; ca &amp;#163;310k; led by Underwood with&#xD;
      Micropix, GEC&#xD;
      Marconi, Avant!, Domain Solutions). A key outcome, by way of example, was&#xD;
      the development of an&#xD;
      advancement to the widely used SPICE circuit description model for the FLC&#xD;
      [6] which has made the&#xD;
      overall design process much more efficient, accurate and robust.&#xD;

    In the REF2014 period Shell has used SQUEEZE software to go from a
      treatment every six months to a treatment every 12 months, saving &amp;#163;3M per
      well per annum. A partial list of the wells for which this OPEX reduction
      has been achieved is Pierce B1, Guillemot P3, and some Bittern wells,
      leading to savings well in excess of &amp;#163;10M per year. [S4]
    As a result of ERPE research, service companies tendering for work are
      required to demonstrate expertise in designing field treatment programmes
      using the SQUEEZE software. In the last three years, 102 industry
      representatives have undergone SQUEEZE training at our Edinburgh campus
      and at industry offices in Aberdeen, Norway, Dubai, Malaysia and USA. As
      examples of service company use of SQUEEZE software, we provide two
      quotes: Clariant Oil state that they "use the most recently updated
        version of the SQUEEZE modelling software (currently SQUEEZE 8) to plan
        all the scale inhibitor squeeze operations that we manage for our
        clients. Across the global organization this equates to approximately
        300 squeezes per year and protects over 500,000,000 barrels of produced
        water resulting in many billions of dollars of protected oil
        production." [S1]
    Nalco Champion "...use the latest version of the SQUEEZE software for
        all our squeeze designs, which annually numbers approximately 250
        squeeze treatments. Along with our current customer contracts we are
        required by operators to demonstrate expertise in the use of the SQUEEZE
        software in tendering for chemical squeeze business. In the past 12
        months Nalco Champion has been able to secure contracts worth over
        $3,000,000 based on our ability to use the current version of this ERPE
        developed software." [S2]
    Prevention by inhibition is by far more cost effective than cure taking
      into account typical workover costs in the UK N Sea of ca. &amp;#163;25 M/well
      excluding the associated loss of production. ERPE is a recognized world
      leader JIP supporting the industry in terms of learning on this key scale
      management area. A Production Chemistry Team Leader at Talisman Sinopec
      Energy UK Ltd commented that "All the scale management activity in the
        North Sea that our company undertakes is impacted by the research that
        has been undertaken by ERPE over the past decade....Talisman-Sinopec
        Energy UK Limited has some fifty four wells under active scale squeeze
        management protecting 36,798 barrels of oil production per day. This
        production typically equates to a significant portion of the company's
        annual production and revenue." [S5]
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    One of the major problems experienced in the oil production industry is
      the formation of mineral scale deposited downhole within an oil reservoir
      and topside. The scale creates a blockage causing a detrimental effect to
      the productivity of the well. ERPE Research in scale management has led to
      the following impacts in the REF2014 period:
    
      Helped Shell save &amp;#163;3M per well per year by reducing the frequency of
        scale inhibiting treatments i.e. squeezes, from a treatment every six
        months to a yearly treatment.
      All scale service companies are required to demonstrate competence in
        ERPE written SQUEEZE software within tender processes. For a single
        contractor (Nalco Champion) in 2012 this resulted in an addition $3.5M
        (&amp;#163;2.3M) of revenue.

      preventing growth across the entire crystal surface area, but just need to
      target the active growth site on the crystal, reducing the volumes of
      chemical required for inhibition.

    The ERPE team of Mackay (Prof), Sorbie (Prof), Todd (Prof) have been on
      staff throughout the REF2014 period.
    Overall, the most important outputs from the ERPE research were:
    
      Demonstration of the importance of reservoir mineralogy in determining
        how scale inhibitors are retained in reservoirs.
      The modelling of adsorption and precipitation scale inhibitor squeeze
        treatments in North Sea fields.
      The development of the methodology to assess the scale risk in fields
        at the Front End Engineering and Design stage of a project.
    
    One of the major problems experienced in the oil production industry is
      the formation of mineral scale. Scale is deposited downhole within an oil
      reservoir and topside, throughout the water production lifecycle of a
      producer well. This creates formation damage (restriction / blockage
      within the rock matrix) and blockage of the production tubing, reducing
      the productivity of the well. Various forms of inorganic scales can be
      found in the North Sea and elsewhere and these are normally prevented
      using a process known as a "squeeze" treatment, where scale inhibitor
      chemicals are applied to the rock formation to stop scale deposition in
      the pipelines and to protect the wellbore area, or by continual chemical
      injection, which treats the topside precipitated calcium carbonate and
      barium sulphate scale.
    Scaling problems arise in high pressure, high temperature (HP/HT) fields
      in the North Sea and around the World, and also in systems where low
      temperatures are prevalent such as long line tie-backs. In order to treat
      the scale that is formed under such severe conditions as these, a solid,
      scientifically-based understanding of the chemical processes leading to
      scale formation is required.
    Since 1993, ERPE has developed a detailed predictive understanding of the
      way in which scale forms and can be treated in a wide variety of operating
      environments. ERPE has achieved this understanding through manufacture of
      specialised laboratory equipment, field condition experiments (up to 200 C
      and 1500 bar), and development of computer software that can model scale
      at the level of pore, core, well and field.
    To give some context for the amount of data that ERPE has generated and
      analysed, our industrial partners, (e.g. BP, Petrobras, Shell, Total,
      Statoil, Talisman, etc), have provided water compositional analysis data
      and samples of core taken from numerous wells in their fields; ERPE has
      received 65,000 lines of 8-12 ion field brine analysis data from operators
      and undertaken reservoir simulation studies on 40 offshore fields for 16
      companies and over 100 reservoir condition corefloods. The data has been
      used to investigate the fundamental mechanisms by which generic chemicals
      inhibit various scales and how they are retained on various mineral
      substrates. [1,2,3] The work has been carried out under a wide range of
      conditions leading to a widespread applicability of the results of the
      research.
    ERPE's SQUEEZE software encapsulates the results of 20 years of detailed
      laboratory experiments and experience in upscaling laboratory measurements
      to field conditions. The SQUEEZE software enabled ERPE researchers to
      conduct appropriate experiments to study field problems, often iterating
      with modelling to ensure requisite data are collected and analysed [4].
      These predictions were then compared with observed field data, and the
      models further refined as necessary. Knowledge gained from analysis of
      produced water compositions and reservoir simulation calculations
      regarding brine displacement through the reservoir, and the impact this
      has on production conditions, is also used to inform recommendations for
      field practice [5], a process that is now routinely carried out by
      industry during the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) phase of
      projects

    1. Impact on governmental policies relating to language
    Crystal's research has led to far reaching and significant impacts on
      governmental policies relating to language usage, planning and
      maintenance, at both national and international level [3.1, 3.2].
    During the REF census period, for instance, Crystal's research has
      impacted on the way UK governmental ministries deploy language in
      communicating with the general public &amp;#8212; part of the so-called "plain
      English campaign" conducted under the UK Government's Public
      Administration Select Committee. A public consultation document on the
      state of Local Government Improvement and Development 2001-2010 entitled "The
        state of the language" [5.1] was circulated by the Select
      Committee. This document relied, in large part, on Crystal's research on
      language usage, especially his findings relating to official language. He
      was subsequently invited, as one of four experts, and the only linguist,
      to appear before the Select Committee at the House of Commons (9th
      July 2009) [5.2]. He provided advice on the issue of official
      language use, and ways to improve linguistic and communication strategies,
      by government, local and national, in official communications with the
      general public. The ensuing report "Bad Language: The Use and Abuse of
        Official Language" (30 Nov. 2009), [5.3] urges "politicians
      and public servants to use language that is clear, honest and
      understandable" and relies heavily on Crystal's expertise: Crystal is the
      only one of the expert witnesses consulted cited in the report (56
      citations). The ensuing impact on language usage was felt UK-wide
      throughout the civil service, which was invited to adopt the report's
      recommendation.
    2. Impact on public awareness and greater understanding of the role
        and value of linguistic diversity in culture and society
    Secondly, Crystal's research has significantly enhanced public awareness
      and understanding of the nature and value of linguistic change and
      diversity. This impact is evidenced by Crystal's dissemination of his
      research findings and engagement with the general public. Since 2008,
      Crystal has published seven books translating his research for a general
      audience, with a common theme of the role and value of linguistic
      diversity. Several of these have been translated, such as Txting: the
        gr8 db8 (2008, Oxford: OUP), which appeared in Chinese since (2010).
      He has made over 100 invited TV/radio appearances to comment and/or report
      on specific issues relating to language diversity, as well as many invited
      podcasts. These include a BBC Newsnight feature with Jeremy Paxman
      (first aired Nov 2008); an appearance on BBC4's It's only a theory
      (first aired Oct 2009); and recordings for the British Library. Some of
      his broadcasts, have subsequently been deposited on YouTube, attracting
      even greater exposure [5.4]. According to YouTube's statistics on
      typical viewers (by age and gender), the viewers across these YouTube
      postings are predominantly (35-54 year old) men, and (45-54 year old)
      women: distinctly above the usual age for university students. Viewing
      figures (&amp;gt;100,000K [5.4]) reveal that viewings have steadily
      increased over time and that almost every country that has internet access
      has viewed his presentations, with some of the postings having the highest
      proportion of hits in Australia, Spain and parts of South America,
      demonstrating worldwide reach of his work. Further public engagement can
      be found in news coverage, such as, for example, in the Guardian, BBC and
      internationally in the Economist, Huffington Post and on Minnesota Public
      Radio. Crystal's public engagement extends to popular media, such as his
      play Living On (1998) on the plight of minority languages, which
      has been staged by various amateur dramatic companies worldwide, and as
      far afield as Yerevan State University in Armenia (2012) [5.5].
    From Nov 2010 to April 2011, Crystal co-curated a major exhibition at the
      British Library in London. Evolving English: one language, many voices,
      was the first time the Library had presented an exhibition on the English
      language and the planning and selection of content relied heavily on
      Crystal's research. He provided the audio examples of earlier periods of
      English used in the exhibition and wrote the accompanying book with the
      same name (London: British Library, 2010). It proved to be the
      best-attended winter exhibition the Library had ever put on. Over 10,000
      visitors that attended the exhibition contributed a recording of their
      spoken English to the British Library's Sound Archive, which can still be
      enjoyed online [5.6].
    3. Global commercial impact in internet advertising applications
    In 2001, together with David Saunders, Crystal set up his company Crystal
      Semantics, with the aim of developing lexical products, including the
      Global Data Model. Uniquely using context, human linguistic intuition and
      semantic relationships between words, this led ultimately to the
      development of the patented Sense Engine&amp;#8482;, which provides the basis of a
      suite of targeted online technology solutions that currently lead the
      field in web-based advertising to make advertisements relevant to the
      subject of each individual webpage.
    In 2006, Crystal sold Crystal Semantics to Ad Pepper Media International
      &amp;#8212; one of the world's largest online advertising technology solutions
      providers, with a reach of over 4 billion monthly impressions of web and
      email. Ad Pepper incorporated the Sense Engine as a reference frame into
      two new web advertising technologies: The iSense system (launched
      September 2007 in Europe, March 2008 in North America) provided the online
      advertising community with the world's first targeted advertising system,
      allowing adverts to load on the most contextually appropriate webpages,
      and in the most appropriate locations, maximising the potential success of
      the advert. The precise advert placement facilitated by iSense has
      transformed the digital advertising industry. It is currently is available
      in 11 languages, has won numerous awards and is applied by the world's
      leading brands including Volkswagen, IBM and Philips (more brand
      references listed on Ad Pepper's website [5.7]). In 2009, Ad
      Pepper launched the SiteScreen system [5.8, 5.9] that also
      incorporates Crystal's Sense Engine, protecting advertisers by identifying
      potentially objectionable content in various categories and thereby making
      and end to ads loading next to such content.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Professor David Crystal's world-leading research on language policy,
      diversity and usage, conducted at Bangor since 2000, has led to a
      transformation in terms of public and political attitudes, both nationally
      and internationally, towards the nature and use of language in public and
      private discourse. In particular, the research has led, since 2008, to an
      increased awareness of linguistic diversity, changes to governmental
      policies on language, and the development of the world's first targeted
      online advertising technology, which today indexes billions of impressions
      across 11 languages to provide real-time data services in the emerging
      online advertising world.

    The research underpinning this case study is that published by Professor
      David Crystal (OBE, Fellow of the British Academy, Fellow of the Learned
      Society of Wales) as Professor of Linguistics between 2000 to 2008 at
      Bangor University.
    Crystal's research focused on three related areas relevant to the impact
      case study. The first concerned the nature of language usage, the dangers
      of prescriptivism, and the nature and development of the English language;
      exemplars include The Stories of English, [3.1] and The
        Fight for English [3.2]. The second area relates the
      cultural value and significance attached to linguistic diversity, and the
      negative impact on a culture when a language dies out, represented by his
      book Language Death [3.3]. A further aspect of Crystal's
      research on linguistic diversity focused on new media, as exemplified by Language
        and the Internet [3.4], also submitted in RAE2008. The third
      area concerns Crystal's development of a semantic content classification
      schema for improving online search, leading a team of over 40
      lexicographers, between 1998 and 2004, to assign lexical senses to
      knowledge categories [3.5, 3.6]. The resulting Global Data Model
      was patented in the UK in July 2003 (patent no. GB2345771), and in the USA
      in December 2007 (patent no. 7305415 B2).
    Specific findings
    Crystal's research has given rise to four sets of specific findings that
      have resulted in significant impact during the current REF census period:
    
      Language usage in communicative contexts, such as in official language
        domains: explicit guidelines on best practice in terms of communicative
        factors such as the message being conveyed, selection of lexis and
        grammatical structures, and avoidance of ambiguities [3.1, 3.4].
      Language diversity: demonstrating its benefits to communities,
        cultural life and heritage, adding value to the wider economy, and
        advocating policies of language maintenance [3.1-3.4].
      The English language: a focus on significant variation arising from
        historical contexts and socio-political factors, drawing attention to
        the dangers of linguistic prescriptivism and an exclusive focus on a
        single variety of 'standard' English; there is particular emphasis on a
        global perspective, and to the role of new media in enhancing rather
        than adversely affecting language [3.1-3.4].
      Semantic taxonomy [3.5, 3.6]: the development of a lexical
        semantic frame of reference (or 'sense engine') within which an online
        classification engine can operate. The aim is to ensure that a web page
        is accurately classified, so that its content can be accessed with
        confidence by anyone using the internet, thus improving relevance and

    Cooper's research in medical diagnostics is driven by the demand for new&#xD;
      miniaturised formats providing low-cost, disposable point-of-care devices,&#xD;
      with applications in near-patient/bathroom environments for screening&#xD;
      chronic diseases and diagnosing acute microbial infections. Similarly, the&#xD;
      new miniaturised formats of Cooper's work have been applied to the drug&#xD;
      discovery process within the pharmaceutical industry through the&#xD;
      development of tools that have improved the ease of data acquisition.&#xD;
      These tools replace labour-intensive patch-clamp electrophysiological&#xD;
      measurements with high-throughput measurements which enable toxicological&#xD;
      information on candidate drugs to be obtained earlier in the development&#xD;
      cycle. Thus, Cooper's research has generated impact through three&#xD;
        spin-out companies providing advanced measurement technologies for a&#xD;
      range of applications:&#xD;
    Mode-Dx (http://www.modedx.com):&#xD;
      Mode Diagnostics (Mode-Dx) was launched in 2008 as a company developing&#xD;
      digital homecare diagnostics. It now employs eight staff and in 2009&#xD;
      secured &amp;#163;1.7M of investment from the IP Group, the Scottish Investment&#xD;
      Bank and the syndicated investor Kelvin Capital. It received a &amp;#163;72k SMART&#xD;
      award in 2011, together with a &amp;#163;23k Innovation Award from Scottish&#xD;
      Enterprise in 2011.&#xD;
    Mode-Dx has developed low-cost, easy-to-use electrochemical diagnostic&#xD;
      products for the consumer market. Following this successful development&#xD;
      work, the company attracted John Brown, formerly Chairman of Axis-Shield,&#xD;
      as its Chairman in 2012. The first product, a colorectal cancer&#xD;
      diagnostic, called measure&amp;#174; BOWEL HEALTH, Figure 1, detects occult&#xD;
      haemoglobin as a proxy for bowel cancer. This product, which is focused on&#xD;
      physician-led screening, has been developed under full ISO processes and&#xD;
      is now CE-marked, with a full product launch due in 2014. Mode-Dx is also&#xD;
      in advanced discussions with a major UK retail pharmacy chain over the&#xD;
      placement of this product throughout the UK for over-the-counter home use&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
    &#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
    Clyde Biosciences (http://www.clydebiosciences.com):
      Cardiotoxicity is a major cause of failure of new medicines in the&#xD;
      pharmaceutical development process. Clyde Biosciences produces&#xD;
      instrumentation, services and biological products for both pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies and contract research organisations to identify these toxic&#xD;
      effects earlier in the development process, thereby reducing costs. The&#xD;
      technology was configured into a new, high-throughput, low-cost instrument&#xD;
      (Figure 2, on left) in collaboration with Cairn Research. This led to Dr&#xD;
      Margaret-Ann Craig being awarded the prestigious Royal Academy of&#xD;
      Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurship Award (2012) for developing&#xD;
      new optical instrumentation, bespoke software (Figure 2, on right) and&#xD;
      microsystems technologies for evaluating new drugs. Subsequently&#xD;
      seed-funding (&amp;#163;50k in 2012) secured through the University's partnership&#xD;
      with IP Group has enabled the successful development of a business model&#xD;
      and strategic industrial collaborations, as well as the sale of&#xD;
      instruments. The company also received a SMART Award (Project value &amp;#163;137k)&#xD;
      in 2013.&#xD;
    Clyde Biosciences has now launched three products: CellOPTIQ (an optical&#xD;
      instrument to assess the toxicology of new medicines); XTEND(SR) (for&#xD;
      direct measurements of drug-induced changes on cardiac cells); and XTEND&#xD;
      (which extends the life of tissue samples). Clyde Biosciences is in the&#xD;
      process of selling its first two cell screening systems (total &amp;#163;330k) to&#xD;
      Imperial College and INSERM and has&#xD;
      developed two partnerships with Astra Zeneca and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson&#xD;
      (both involving contracts for screening of drug candidate libraries).&#xD;
    &#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
    SAW-Dx: SAW-Dx is a micro-SME, which uses phononic crystals as&#xD;
      `acoustic holograms' to control the interaction between the ultrasonic&#xD;
      fields generated using surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices and the&#xD;
      diagnostic sample. Funding from the Scottish Enterprise Proof-of-Concept&#xD;
      Fund (2010-12) enabled the technology to be implemented on low-cost&#xD;
      disposable chips, coupled into the ultrasonic piezoelectric transducers. A&#xD;
      manufacturing technology has been developed with Epigem through a&#xD;
      TSB-funded programme (TS/1000097/1, 2010-12). Dr Reboud was awarded the&#xD;
      Royal Academy of Engineering ERA Foundation Entrepreneurship Award (2013)&#xD;
      to translate the technology into a DNA-based diagnostics technology,&#xD;
      leading to seed venture funding from IP Group in 2013. The company was&#xD;
      formed in March 2013 and now works on three products.&#xD;
    Firstly, in a development programme with a consultant in Sexual Health&#xD;
      &amp;amp; HIV Medicine, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and funded by the NHS,&#xD;
      SAW-Dx is developing integrated diagnostics for sexual health. The product&#xD;
      uses the company's proprietary technologies for sample preparation and&#xD;
      rapid detection, including a new acoustically driven, multiplexed DNA&#xD;
      isothermal amplification protocol. The aim is to break the cycle of&#xD;
      infection and treatment, by providing rapid diagnosis of a panel of&#xD;
      pathogens, enabling the patient to be treated prior to leaving the clinic.&#xD;
    A second product, focussed on food security, has seen SAW-Dx adapt its&#xD;
      multiplexed human DNA technologies for sexual health to veterinary&#xD;
      applications, with a specific focus on disease diagnosis in cattle and&#xD;
      buffalo artificial insemination stations in India. India produces 125bn&#xD;
      litres of milk per annum and the `white revolution' of cow and buffalo&#xD;
      milk production underpins its economy. SAW-Dx works on developing these&#xD;
      products with the Indian Veterinary Research Institute and the UK Animal&#xD;
      Health and Veterinary Laboratory Agency.&#xD;
    Finally, SAW-Dx has also secured a TSB grant (TS/L003392/1), working with&#xD;
      MV Diagnostics Ltd and Epigem to develop DNA and protein biomarker tests&#xD;
      for tuberculosis (TB), and sees longer-term products based upon developing&#xD;
      assays for rapid TB testing.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Fifteen years of research in advanced Lab-on-a-Chip technologies at the&#xD;
      University of Glasgow has led to three spin-out companies: Mode-Dx, Clyde&#xD;
      Biosciences and SAW-Dx. Since 2008 these companies have developed a range&#xD;
      of products and services for the diagnostic screening of chronic diseases,&#xD;
      for the detection of acute infections and for improving the drug discovery&#xD;
      process. The three companies have secured a total of &amp;#163;2.3M in venture&#xD;
      funding and secured key strategic collaborations with stakeholders&#xD;
      including industry partners and the NHS.&#xD;

    Prof Jonathan Cooper (Lecturer 1991-96, Senior Lecturer 1996-98,&#xD;
      Professor 1998-present) leads the Advanced Medical Diagnostics Group in&#xD;
      the School of Engineering, and has developed new Lab-on-a-Chip and&#xD;
      biosensors technologies, based upon acoustic, optical and electrochemical&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
    Lab-on-a-Chip research in Cooper's group started in 1999, supported by a&#xD;
      &amp;#163;3.2M DTI-EPSRC Foresight LINK "Lab on a Chip" programme. The project was&#xD;
      co-ordinated by Dr Derek Craston (LGC, now also Government Chemist), and&#xD;
      was carried out in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Unilever and&#xD;
      Kodak together with a group of SMEs, including Epigem. Cooper's research&#xD;
      has enabled the development of new, advanced microfabrication techniques&#xD;
      for on-chip sensing and interconnect technologies for microfludics.&#xD;
      Cooper, Dr Igata (Research Assistant (RA) 2000-01) and Dr Arundell (RA&#xD;
      2002) integrated analytical technologies into microfluidic devices using&#xD;
      novel fluidic handling strategies for both diagnostic and cell based&#xD;
      assays [1].&#xD;
    This work was followed by a Scottish Higher Education Funding Council&#xD;
      grant, `Integrated Diagnostics for Environmental and Analytical Systems'.&#xD;
      This supported underpinning research in which Cooper and Dr Johannessen&#xD;
      (RA, 2001-04) developed sensors and optimised packaging to create a fully&#xD;
      functional ingestible prototype diagnostic device (or pill). This work,&#xD;
      when combined with the earlier DTI-EPSRC research, was instrumental in&#xD;
      producing a pill-based sensor [2], a concept which led to the formation of&#xD;
      Mode-Dx.&#xD;
    In parallel with these activities, the EPSRC supported the&#xD;
      Bio-Nanotechnology Interdisciplinary Research Centre (IRC), a&#xD;
      collaboration with Professor Ryan (University of Oxford) and Dr Molloy&#xD;
      (National Institute for Medical Research) (GR/R45659/01, 2002-09). Here,&#xD;
      Cooper led the cellular nanotechnology theme that developed tools for&#xD;
      exploring cell-based assays in microfluidic systems. This research, which&#xD;
      was carried out in collaboration with Professor Smith (Institute of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, 1997-present),&#xD;
      and Dr Klauke (RA 1999-2009, Research Technologist 2009-11), developed&#xD;
      microarrays for electrically stimulating heart cells [3].&#xD;
    Working within a DTI-funded Micro and Nano Technology Programme in&#xD;
      2005-08 with Dr Warrington and Dr Cordingley (GSK), Dr Ryan (Epigem), and&#xD;
      Dr Craston (LGC), the University of Glasgow group translated their work&#xD;
      into an industrial context and developed high-throughput microfluidic&#xD;
      cell-based assays for pharmaceutical testing (relating the new platform to&#xD;
      industry-standard assays [4]). Supported by BBSRC (BB/H013369/1) and a&#xD;
      Scottish Enterprise Proof-of-Concept Grant (POC/BPT011), Cooper and Smith&#xD;
      subsequently implemented these high-throughput technologies as new&#xD;
      fluorescence based assay formats to explore cardiotoxic effects of drugs&#xD;
      on heart cells. A prototype instrument for optical measurements of action&#xD;
      potential and ion flux was developed with Martyn Reynolds at Cairn&#xD;
      Research, which resulted in the formation of Clyde Biosciences in 2012 to&#xD;
      provide low-cost, early assessment of cardiotoxicity as part of the&#xD;
      development process of new medicines.&#xD;
    Most recently, research within the field of acoustics and microfluidics&#xD;
      which was underpinned by long-term IRC funding in Proteomic Technologies&#xD;
      (BB/C511572) and a Research Landscape Grant (EP/I017887/1) enabled Cooper,&#xD;
      Dr Wilson (RA 2005-present) and Dr Reboud (RA 2009-12, Research Fellow&#xD;
      2012-present) to develop frequency dependent phononic structures for&#xD;
      shaping ultrasonic fields [5]. This invention is described in&#xD;
      WO/2012/114076, whilst methods for manufacturing the technology, developed&#xD;
      with Dr Ryan of Epigem under a TSB grant (TSB/61-135, 2010-12), are&#xD;
      described in WO/2011/023949. Work within a Scottish Enterprise&#xD;
      Proof-of-Concept grant (POC/13-LSM003) permitted the microfluidic research&#xD;
      to be translated into a prototype instrument for DNA testing of infectious&#xD;
      diseases, and led to the formation of SAW-Dx. Most recently, the&#xD;
      technology was validated through the detection of malaria in blood [6],&#xD;
      work supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant&#xD;
      OPP1032927).&#xD;

    Context
    Engineering is crucial to the Government's strategy to rebalance the UK
      economy. The sector
      accounted for a fifth of UK GDP in 2009 and employs over 4.5 million
      people across nearly half a
      million businesses representing 24% of UK turnover. In spite of this,
      there is still a shortage of
      young people studying STEM subjects, leading to a shortfall in the number
      of high-quality
      engineering graduates. Public engagement with our research has led to
      impacts in public
      awareness of the impact of science on society and in schoolchildren's
      interest in STEM subjects.
    Pathways to Impact
    We have used the state-of-the-art imaging capability developed through
      our research activities to
      demonstrate the behaviour of advanced materials and components in a new
      and exciting way. Our
      3D journey through a jet engine entitled `So You Think You Can
          Design A Jet Engine' is an
      excellent toolkit for enthusing school children and the general public
      about the wonders of
      engineering and materials. The University of Manchester, partnering with
      Rolls-Royce, the
      Museum of Science &amp;amp; Industry (MOSI), Institute of Materials, Minerals
      and Mining, Royal Academy
      of Engineering, Manufacturing Institute, NW Aerospace Alliance and NW
      Development Agency
      have engaged with thousands of schoolchildren, teachers and parents. The
      toolkit consists of:
    
      
Interactive 3D stereoscopic journey through a jet engine -
        developed in collaboration
        with Rolls-Royce and based on our research into X-ray imaging, this 3D
        display allows
        visitors to explore the interior of a Trent 900 engine from an Airbus
        A380. Short linked
        videos explain how the engine design relates to materials research.
      
Jet engine designer software - reinforces concepts learned
        about materials selection in
        engines by allowing young people to design their own engines and see if
        they can fly.
      
Materials Top Trump Cards support the jet engine design game by
        allowing users to
        compare materials, and can also be used as a separate game of guessing
        material
        properties.
      
Augmented reality tools show materials superimposed with their
        microstructure.
      
Aviation and Environment debate pack to debate the global
        impacts of our science.
    
    Reach and Significance
    These public outreach activities have taken place in the 2008-2013 period
      with thousands of young
      people and hundreds of teachers, stimulating their interest in science and
      technology through the
      variety of different mechanisms listed below These outreach activities
      were recognised by the
      Royal Academy of Engineering through the award of its Nexia Solutions
      Education Innovation
      prize. The project was also showcased as an exemplar of good practice at
      two EPSRC PPE
      regional workshops (Manchester and Birmingham, 2008), and was selected for
      the Royal Academy
      of Engineering Exhibition (2009).
    Make It in Manufacturing Campaign [A]
    The Manufacturing Institute launched the Make It in Manufacturing
      campaign to promote the
      breadth of exciting and interesting career opportunities the sector can
      offer to the brightest and
      best young people. It is the banner for a whole raft of high profile
      education and awareness raising
      activities aimed at introducing teenagers to manufacturing and dispelling
      the many myths that
      contribute to a negative public image of the sector. In 2009 we
      participated in Skills North West
      Make it in Manufacturing Campaign at the Reebok Stadium, Bolton. Of the
      15,000 12/13 pupils
      attending 2,250 participated in the Design a Jet Engine activity over 3
      days. After visiting the Make
      It stand, 70% wanted to know more about careers in Manufacturing and
      Engineering, 82% would
      recommend a career in manufacturing and Engineering to a friend and 70%
      had positively
      changed their minds about engineering.
    Permanent Interactive Display at MOSI [B,C]
    To maximise our accessible target audience we partnered with MOSI to
      enable sustainability of the
      impact. How to Design a Jet Engine is now on permanent display at the Air
      &amp;amp; Space Gallery of the
      Museum of Science &amp;amp; Industry (Manchester). Exposure of the display
      over the period has been
      extensive targeting both our primary audience of schools at KS4, as well
      as secondary audience of
      family visitors. In the 2010 MOSI report the exhibit was highlighted has
      been very popular. In 2009
      MOSI attracted 600,000 visitors of which 50,000 were educational in
      nature. The display has also
      acted as a focal point for 3 Meet the Engineer Family days at MOSI (2009)
      with 500 visitors
      spending over an hour each doing interactive challenges and an Environment
      debate day at
      Museum of Science &amp;amp; Industry (MOSI), October 2009 for 40 Year 9-11
      pupils
    Broader Outreach [D]
    We have made extensive use of a wide range of different public, school
      and teaching engagement
      mechanisms. Examples of these have included large scale public events
      including: 6 Air shows
      (Farnborough (2008 - 2012), Southport (2009 - 2011)) ~12,000 total
      visitors to stand; Big Bang fair
      (2009, 2010) in partnership with Rolls-Royce - ~9,000 school visitors; and
      2 science shows (2009
      and 2010) at `Scientrific', Wrexham Science Festival - ~5,000 visitors.
      Manchester Science
      Festival Schools Events along with Science days at Schools and Educator
      Conferences directly
      reached ca. 1,500 students and 200 teachers.
    Inspiring the Future [E]
    The RAE Ingenious Award funded the training of 30 young engineers in
      public engagement. The
      trainees gained practical experience by participating in the public and
      schools events above. Some
      97% of the participants indicated that their presentation skills had
      improved and that they had
      increased their interest in public engagement. The success of these
      outreach activities has led to
      the development of a follow-on activity based upon School of Materials
      research on materials for
      the nuclear power industry: "So you think you know about nuclear energy!"
      (2010-2014).
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    This prize-winning outreach project exploits our capability in 3D X-ray
      imaging to showcase our

    The impact is based on research in the School of Materials into
      aeroengine materials and 3D X-ray
      tomography. The aeroengine research was initiated in 1999 when JIF/EPSRC
      funding enabled the
      establishment of the Stress and Damage Characterisation Unit, now an
      internationally recognised
      centre of excellence for residual stress characterisation. In 2007, the
      Henry Moseley X-ray Imaging
      Facility was set up through an EPSRC grant; the Facility contains 7 X-ray
      scanners, the widest
      range of laboratory CT systems in the UK. Research into materials for use
      in jet engines includes:
    
      Working with samples joined using industrial-scale inertia welding
        equipment at
        Manufacturing Technology Inc (MTI) in the USA and at Rolls-Royce, we
        were able to
        characterise the steep microstructural gradients and residual stresses
        introduced by a new
        process, namely inertia rotational welding, developed specifically to
        join the next generation
        of high f067' containing RR1000 Ni superalloy discs for jet engines.
        Using the ISIS neutron
        source we were able to carry across optimised treatments from small
        prototype tests to a
        full scale disc assembly [1, 6]. A key finding was that the new high
        f067' containing alloys
        generate larger residual stresses and require higher post-weld heat
        treatments than
        conventional alloys.
      Linear friction welding has been proposed as a method for joining
        single crystal blades to
        discs for jet engines. We were the first to measure the residual
        stresses and effects of
        crystal orientation on weldability and microstructural evolution [2].
      We were able to develop novel high resolution sub-surface mapping of
        residual stress by
        synchrotron diffraction to determine the residual stresses introduced by
        laser peening in
        both plates and jet engine fan blade roots [3]. We were able to show
        how, unlike
        conventional shot peening, laser peening produces stresses deep into the
        blade roots that
        are resistant to fretting in-service.
      Our X-ray facility is specially designed for in situ imaging of
        engineering materials and
        components across a wide range of environments, timescales and length
        scales [5]. We
        were the first to develop techniques able to monitor in 3D how the
        development of a
        thermally-grown oxide sub-surface at the ceramic top-coat/metal-bond
        coat interface of a
        jet engine turbine blade leads to flaws that ultimately cause spalling
        of the coating [4].

    Context
    Methods of determining small biological molecule 3D-conformation for use
      in structure-based design have numerous limitations:
    
      protein co-crystallography for a novel target is very expensive and
        can take years of trial and error
      the anhydrous packing environment in small molecule crystals leads to
        non-physiological conformations
      the theoretical nature of computational modelling leads to unreliable
        3D-predictions
      NMR methods cannot account for flexibility without resorting to
        inaccurate computational chemistry
    
    The MolGyrate technology overcomes these limitations, bringing accurate,
      experimentally- determined solution structures (which relate directly to
      the bioactive conformation [6]) to the market. This method has proven
      capable of producing accurate bioactive structures for natural ligands,
      performing rapid hit identification and removing bottlenecks in lead
      optimisation, accelerating medicinal chemistry, reducing costs and
      increasing productivity. To illustrate:
    
      C4X Discovery determined the flexible structure of carazolol in a
        week, validating it to have the same shape as in the 03b22-adrenergic
        receptor co-crystal.
      The company also solved an antagonist of the Class B GPCR
        corticotropin-releasing factor receptor in the same time frame. It is
        successfully using this approach to develop novel selective inhibitors
        of the orexin-1 receptor, with potential to treat anxiety and addiction.
		
      Pathways to impact
      The technology was taken from the laboratory to a spin-out company
        through research by Almond and Blundell (via research, translational and
        proof-of-concept funding and a secondment from UoM). A prototype was
        developed using BBSRC Follow-on funding (for demonstration to investors
        and pharmaceutical clients). The drafting of a business plan was enabled
        by a BBSRC/RSE Enterprise Fellowship awarded to Almond in 2007.
        Conformetrix was assigned IP from the UoM and incorporated in 2007 (its
        name changed to C4X Discovery in 2013).
      Reach and significance of the impact
      During the impact period the success of C4X Discovery and the
        underpinning research, which includes a research collaboration with
        AstraZeneca (AZ) across its pre-clinical therapeutic pipeline, have been
        recognised through a series of awards: Bionow Start Up Company of the
        Year (2008), NorthWest Development Agency GRAND award for Innovative
        R&amp;amp;D (2009), and Bionow Emerging Biomedical Technology Project of the
        Year (2011). Almond was also a finalist in the BBSRC Innovator of the
        Year competition (2009) [A], and the company is profiled in a BBSRC
        Impact Evidence Report (2012) [B]. More recently, the UoM and UoM IP
        were joint runners-up in the 2013 BBSRC Fostering Innovation `Activating
        Impact' Awards (with C4X Discovery being one of two examples).
      Formation of a successful spin-out company:
        Since 2008 C4X Discovery has raised several &amp;#163;million in venture capital
        funding (specific amount not disclosed due to commercial
        confidentiality), through a series of investments from Aquarius Equity
        Partners [C], a fund focussed on UK life science technology.
      In September 2012, Aquarius Equity Partners announced the release of a
        third tranche of investment, triggered by significant progress of the
        company against milestones. [text removed for publication].
      Industry investment in R&amp;amp;D through in-house evaluation
            studies:
        C4X Discovery has provided paid services to the world's largest
        pharmaceutical and biotech companies (not disclosed due to commercial
        confidentiality). [text removed for publication].
      Collaborative agreement with AstraZeneca to enhance drug
            discovery and optimisation:
        In 2012 C4X Discovery announced a two-year research collaboration
        agreement with AZ, under which MolGyrate will be applied across AZ's
        entire pre-clinical therapeutic pipeline to enhance lead discovery and
        hit identification. The VP and Head of Discovery Sciences at AZ said:
      "We are excited to be working with Conformetrix. We believe their
          technology will provide a powerful addition to our hit identification
          and lead optimisation approaches, supporting our strategic objectives
          to improve the quality and choice of candidate compounds for our early
          pipeline" [D].
      Also in BioCentury, a US-based biotech business newsletter, he
        said:
      "As we've done due diligence, we've been looking to see if there is
          anything else out there that competes with Conformetrix's technology,
          and we feel it is truly unique" [E].
      The collaborative agreement with Conformetrix forms part of a revamped
        business development strategy for AZ [F]. The research collaboration is
        one of only two involving companies/groups in Europe (and the only UK
        deal, the majority being US-based ventures) and involves a team drawn
        from both companies to manage the research strategy [G]. C4X Discovery
        received an undisclosed upfront payment and research funding, and is
        eligible for funding milestones as certain targets are met.
      </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    A critical step in drug discovery is accurate determination of bioactive
      3-dimensional structures of biologically-relevant molecules. Almond and
      Blundell's proprietary method for analysing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
      (NMR) data has led to a world-first capability and establishment of the
      company Conformetrix (renamed C4X Discovery in 2013). The platform
      technology ('MolGyrate') is used to determine the dynamic
      3-dimensional-conformation of biologically relevant molecules directly
      from NMR data within weeks, compared with months to years for traditional
      methods. C4X Discovery has secured substantial private investment (the
      company has not disclosed the amount). In 2012 AstraZeneca began to apply
      the technology across their entire pre-clinical therapeutic pipeline to
      enhance lead discovery and hit identification.

    Background
    The impact is based on research at the University of Manchester (UoM)
      from 2005-2008. The key researchers were:
    Dr Andrew Almond (Lecturer, 2005-date; co-founder of Conformetrix / C4X
      Discovery Ltd.) Dr Charles Blundell (Post-Doctoral Research Associate,
      2005-2008; co-founder of C4X Discovery Ltd.; Chief Scientist C4X Discovery
      Ltd, 2008-date)
    The researchers worked on carbohydrate 3D-conformation, which poses a
      unique set of research problems given the high carbohydrate flexibility.
      One strand of their research determined the molecular 3D-shape of the
      flexible polysaccharide hyaluronan, which is distributed widely throughout
      mammalian connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. Almond and Blundell
      achieved this by performing computer simulations of the molecule in the
      presence of aqueous solvent, preparing pure samples in the laboratory and
      performing detailed experiments to validate the computational results
      [1-5]. Prior hypotheses relating to assembly of hyaluronan (and hence
      connective tissue) were based on a plastic space-filling molecular model;
      the discovery of hyaluronan's accurate 3-dimensional shape and flexibility
      has dramatically altered the understanding of extracellular matrix
      biology.
    Discovery and patent application
    During their research on hyaluronan (2005-2008), Almond and Blundell
      developed a quantitative theory that enabled raw NMR experimental data to
      be used to calculate a quantified flexible structure of a hyaluronan
      hexasaccharide without the need for inaccurate computer simulations. The
      molecular 3D-shape of this molecule was resolved for the first time,
      validating the new methodology on an inherently flexible biomolecule; a
      world first. At this time it was realised that the nascent technological
      breakthrough could be applied to any small flexible molecule [6], drugs
      and peptides in particular. Using proof-of-concept funding from UoM, the
      dynamic 3D-structures of several important molecules were resolved. A
      UK-patent entitled, "Method for determining three- dimensional structures
      of dynamic molecules," was filed in 2007 (applicants: Blundell CD and
      Almond A; UK patent application number 0718027.6). The patent has reached
      the National phase and applications have been filed in all major
      territories.

    Context
    Despite the advantageous electroluminescent and photoluminescent
      properties of quantum dot nanoparticles, their incorporation into
      next-generation consumer electronics has been precluded by the absence of
      a means to manufacture both sufficient quantities and materials that are
      free of toxic heavy metals in-order to comply with `Restriction of
      Hazardous Substances' (RoHS) legislation.
    Pathways to impact
      The research conducted at the University of Manchester enabled the
      preparation of bulk quantities of quantum dots free of toxic heavy metals,
      which led to the spinout of Nanoco Technologies in 2001-2 from the School
      of Chemistry based on its proprietary technology covered, by 19 patents
      [4,5].
    Whilst located within the School of Chemistry building, Nanoco grew to
      10-12 workers before moving to dedicated premises where it experienced
      extraordinary growth between 2004-2013. Currently, Nanoco operates from
      the company's headquarters and R&amp;amp;D facility in Manchester, a
      production plant in Runcorn and sales offices located in Japan and the
      United States.[A]
    Impact.
      During the period 1st January 2008 to 31st July 2013, Nanoco Technologies
      established itself as the world's leading manufacturer and supplier of
      commercial quantities of RoHS compliant (RoHS 2002/95/EC) quantum dots,
      employing approximately 95 staff at a total cost of over &amp;#163;3m per year and
      generating over &amp;#163;10.5m revenue since 1st August 2008 [B].
    On the 1st May 2009 Nanoco Group plc began trading on the Alternative
      Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange and since this time has
      grown its market capitalisation to &amp;#163;384m (31/7/2013).
    Nanoco's strategic partnerships have generated significant secondary
      impact through job creation throughout its associated supply chain and
      within its partner companies. Currently, Nanoco's quantum dot's are being
      developed with its strategic partners in several areas including displays
      and photovoltaic solar cells as follows:-
    1. Displays
      Display technology has progressed from bulky cathode ray tubes to plasma
      screens, liquid crystal displays and more recently to energy efficient
      organic light emitting diodes (OLED). OLED technology has provided low
      power, lightweight, thinner displays of improved user experience through
      wider viewing angles and improved contrast. However, OLED
      display technology is limited to the fabrication of small displays
      employing wasteful and energy inefficient evaporation procedures with a
      high discard rates.
    Quantum dot electroluminescent display technology (QD TV&amp;#8482;) offers a
      tremendous advantage over existing OLED-technology. Quantum dots have been
      printed using facile low cost techniques into various sizes of lightweight
      flexible displays. High photoluminescence quantum yields render the
      displays energy efficient, narrow emission band-width provides displays of
      superior optical resolution, whilst the high stability of inorganic
      quantum dots provides displays with improved lifetimes.
    Since 2011, Nanoco has delivered 1kg batches of both red and green
      coloured quantum dots worth &amp;#163;2.5m and achieved performance milestones that
      have generated an additional &amp;#163;1.1M. In January 2013 Nanoco entered into an
      exclusive licensing agreement with Dow Electronic Materials' who are
      opening a production facility in the far-east to manufacture quantum dots
      and have exclusive worldwide rights for the sale, marketing and
      manufacture of Nanoco's quantum dots for use in electronic displays [C].
    2. Photovoltaic solar cells
      The world's growing demand for power is met predominantly by the
      combustion of fossil fuels (13TW, 87%). As fossil fuels become depleted
      and the demand for cleaner, greener energy increases it is imperative that
      renewable energy becomes a more significant proportion of our energy mix.
      Currently, solar power contributes a negligible 0.03% toward the global
      energy mix despite the earth receiving sufficient energy from the sun to
      meet its current and future energy demand (&amp;gt;120,000 TW). The widespread
      adoption of solar power has been impeded by the high cost of cells,
      principally of silicon fabricated by expensive methods.
    In partnership with a Japanese automotive firm that has invested
      approximately &amp;#163;1m and `Tokyo Electron' who have invested an undisclosed
      amount, Nanoco has exploited its proprietary intellectual property and
      expertise to prepare a range of novel copper indium gallium diselenide and
      copper indium diselenide quantum dot inks that have been fabricated into
      solar cell devices of good efficiencies using conventional low cost
      printing techniques [D].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Nanoco, is a University of Manchester spin out company having a current
      market capitalisation of &amp;#163;384m (31/7/2013). Nanoco's proprietary processes
      enable, for the first time, commercial quantities of high-quality quantum
      dot nanoparticles, free of toxic heavy-metals, to be manufactured
      economically &amp;#8212; for incorporation into next-generation displays &amp;amp;
      solar-cells."
	  As a result of its world-leading disruptive technology,
      Nanoco has, in the REF period, forged down-stream global business
      partnerships that have generated around &amp;#163;11m revenue, creating 95 jobs
      with Nanoco (at a cost of over &amp;#163;3m/year), substantial secondary employment
      in the supply chain, and underpinning technology to enable the delivery of
      more energy-efficient electronic devices.

    All of the papers appear in peer-reviewed international journals that led
      to Professor O'Brien being invited to present his research
      internationally. The patents capture the underpinning research that forms
      the basis of Nanoco Technologies. Professor O'Brien was made FRS in 2013
      largely for his contributions to the development of the chemistry
      described in this Impact Case.

    Research conducted at the University of Manchester developed novel
      processes to prepare, reproducibly, bulk quantities of high-quality
      quantum dot nanoparticles from non-heavy metal precursors. [4,5]
    The research was carried out by key Manchester researchers:
    
      Paul O'Brien &amp;#8212; Professor of Materials Chemistry (1999-present);
      Nigel Picket &amp;#8212; PDRA (2000-2004);
      Steve Daniels &amp;#8212; PhD student (2001-2004).
    
    Most often, quantum dots have been prepared by `hot-injection methods'
      rapidly introducing solutions of often hazardous precursor compounds into
      a vast excess of hot solvent, resulting in nucleation and subsequent
      growth of the quantum dot nanoparticles by `heating-up' methodologies. The
      approach can be severely limited by being non-reproducible in terms of the
      stability, size and colour of the quantum dot nanoparticles produced.
    The molecular seeding process developed at Manchester circumvented these
      limitations. In this approach, the precursor compounds are heated in the
      presence of a molecular-cluster in a single-pot reaction. The molecular
      cluster serves as a prefabricated template to nucleate nanoparticle
      growth, offering more accurate control over the size and associated
      emission wavelength of the resulting quantum dots. [3]
    This seeding process was then further developed at Manchester, coating
      the quantum dot nanoparticles with a wide band-gap inorganic shell in
      order to confine the exciton generated within the quantum dot, upon
      irradiation, from the external environment. This improved both the
      stability and brightness of the quantum dot nanoparticles. [1,2,6]

    The following exemplifies OMIC impact in teems of policy and up
        skilling industry as well as
        two examples of economic impact based upon research with SME deriving
        from basic
        research performed within the UoA.
    OMIC [A,B,C,D]
    Context: The Organic Materials Innovation Centre (OMIC) was
      established by initial funding of
      &amp;#163;4.25m from the Department of Trade and Industry in 2002 to the University
      of Manchester for
      work on knowledge transfer from academe to industry in the thematic areas
      of Complex Fluids,
      Organic Electronics, Biomaterials and High Performance
        Materials. Its success [A] led to an award
      from the North West Development Agency of over &amp;#163;8m (ca. &amp;#163;3m to
      Manchester) in October 2008
      to start the North West Knowledge Centre for Materials Chemistry (KCMC,
      2008-2012) [B]. In the
      first four years of operation (2008-12), the KCMC in Manchester has
      carried out 100 projects with
      industry for a value of over &amp;#163;5.4m which includes over &amp;#163;3.2M of industry
      income [C].
    Pathways to Impact: OMIC enables effective knowledge transfer to
      industry through a flexible
      engagement model, which is attractive for the smallest SME through to the
      largest multinational.
      Flexibility is enabled through the ability to engage in projects as short
      as a few weeks with the
      ability through UoM procedures to put in place agreements between parties
      on a very short time
      scale. Projects have included embedding industrial researchers in the OMIC
      laboratories as well as
      OMIC scientists into industrial laboratories. Knowledge transfer is also
      facilitated through tailored
      CPD and training events for industry in thematic areas where OMIC has
      recognized academic
      excellence.
    Impact: Through its position as one of the UK's four academic,
      plastic electronics centres of
      excellence, as recognised in the House of Commons Select Report in 2008
      [D], OMIC is a
      founding member of the Plastic Electronics Leadership Group and these
      activities are helping to
      advocate and shape the UK strategy in this emerging field and direct TSB
      funding in the area.
      Internationally, OMIC through Professor Yeates was invited to contribute
      as experts to the
      international White Paper from the Chemical Sciences and Society Summit
      (CS3) on `Organic
      Electronics for a Better Tomorrow: Innovation, Accessibility,
      Sustainability' 2012 and also the EU
      project on developing the roadmap for digital fabrication `Diginova'. As
      part of this advocacy, OMIC
      has hosted inward investment missions from Finland, Korea and Belgium as
      well as providing
      training to over 250 people in industry since 2008. Events have included
      `Future generation solar
      cells' in 2008, `Opportunities in printed solar cells', 2009, and
      `Chemicals and materials for printed
      electronics', 2011. A recent survey by the Plastic Electronics Leadership
      Group confirmed that
      while the industry is still in its infancy, there are now over 150
      businesses in the UK with activities
      in this field, more than double that of four years ago. Most of those are
      SMEs developing materials
      and devices but there are already some end-users such as De La Rue and
      Reckitt-Benckiser
      working to apply the technology in their products.
    ACAL Energy [E]
    Context: Fuel cells produce electrical power directly from
      chemicals and offer the potential to be a
      more efficient and clean way to generate power when compared to the
      combustion of fuels.
      Hydrogen-fuelled 10-100 kW fuel cells provide a cost-effective method for
      power production
      particularly at sites where lower life-cycle costs, cleaner and quieter
      operation, longer runtimes,
      and lower maintenance requirements are important. However concerns over
      cost and lifetime have
      limited their adoption. ACAL Energy is an UK SME developing a novel
      approach to the fuel cell
      cathode &amp;#8212; the FlowCath&amp;#174; technology.
    Pathways to Impact: ACAL Energy collaborated with the Collison and
      May (2) group by
      embedding a company scientist within the group and by consultancy from
      2006, because of their
      expertise on polyoxometallates. This research led to the initial FlowCath&amp;#174;
      technology. Collaboration
      with the Turner and Proctor groups (5) through a combination of the
      flexible OMIC model, KTP and
      PhD funding on novel nitrogen-containing ligands is enabling more
      efficient fuel cells to be
      developed.
    Impact: Since 2008 ACAL Energy has received &amp;#163;15m of venture
      capital investment, created in
      excess of 20 jobs and won the Carbon Trust's Polymer Fuel Cell Challenge.
      ACAL Energy's
      patented FlowCath&amp;#174; technology is the first example of a non-Pt
      based fuel cell cathode system and
      the first installation is now located in at the Solvay Interox Chemical
      Plant, UK. ACAL Energy fuel
      cells using a polyoxometallate catalyst compete with conventional
      electricity generators by
      reducing the platinum content by up to 80% which represents 20-25 % of the
      total cost of a system.
      These fuel cells show no deterioration in performance after 10,000 hrs of
      rigorous automotive test
      cycles (equivalent to 300,000 miles). This is comparable to the best
      light-weight diesel engines
      (100kW equivalent to a 2 L diesel engine) and exceeds the 2017 US
      Department of Energy (DoE)
      industry target for fuel cell powered vehicles. The durability of the fuel
      cells allows the system to be
      applied to stationary power applications where 40,000 hrs (10 years of
      product lifetime) operation
      is required. As a result ACAL Energy fuel cell units will be installed at
      the UK's first open access H2
      refuelling station to be located at Honda's manufacturing site in Swindon.
    Byotrol [F]
    Context: Cleaning products, such as bleach and alcohol-based
      products, stop working as soon as
      they dry, which allows bacteria and other microbes to quickly recolonize;
      a single surviving
      bacterium can produce up to 8 million descendants by the next day. In
      contrast, Byotrol technology
      which is based upon surfactant-polymer mixtures kills and destroys
      instantaneously bacteria and
      viruses and then dries to form a long-lasting antimicrobial barrier that
      stops germs from
      re-populating for up to 24 hrs.
    Pathways to Impact: In 2007, Byotrol approached the University of
      Manchester based upon our
      previous work in the area of complex aqueous surfactant mixtures [3], and
      our then unpublished
      work on complex aqueous polymer-surfactant mixtures [6] with the aim of
      understanding the
      mechanism of long-lasting antimicrobial performance and of developing more
      effective and
      reproducible formulations which in turn could lead to a stronger IP
      position in this highly
      competitive market. This resulted in the filing of patent WO2010043863,
      which covers and
      exemplifies novel formulation classes, addressing the dual challenges of
      effective antimicrobial kill
      coupled with long term follow-on performance. This was continued by a one
      year Molecular
      Engineering Translational Research Centre (METRC) proof of concept grant
      in 2009-2010 and
      supported by a direct funded iCASE PhD 2009-13.
    Impact: The research performed under the above engagement modes
      has contributed to the
      technology being further developed and optimized to provide reproducible,
      fast acting and powerful
      performance across all microbial classes [E]: bacteria, viruses, fungi,
      moulds &amp;amp; algae killing up to
      99.99% of germs in 30 seconds when tested against the most stringent test
      methodologies
      including BS:EN 1276 Standard, BS:EN 13697 Standard, BS:EN 1650 Standard,
      BS:EN 14476
      Standard and Residual Abrasion Testing methodologies. In 2013, Byotrol
      reported sales of &amp;#163;2.19m
      with a year-on-year growth of 12% per annum. Byotrol technology has been
      introduced into a wide
      range of consumer products across the healthcare, food and beverage and
      consumer goods
      sectors [E], through both direct sales and partnership with some of the
      world's leading brands
      including Boots, PZ Cussons, Heinz, Kimberley Clark, Marks and Spencer and
      Rentokil Initial
      Group (UltraProtect&amp;#8482;).
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The activities of the Organic Materials Innovation Centre (OMIC) at the
      University of Manchester
      generate impact from its research activities through knowledge transfer to
      industry. This is
      exemplified by:
    
      Enabled UK SME ACAL Energy, through technology transfer and
        development, to create in
        excess of 20 jobs, raise &amp;#163;15m of venture capital investment to develop
        their FlowCath&amp;#174;
        fuel-cell technology.
      Enabled UK SME Byotrol, through improved understanding to develop
        novel anti-microbial
        technology which has been licensed to global fast moving consumer goods
        companies with
        sales of &amp;#163;2.19m per annum.
    
    Provision of research-based training in the field of printed electronics
      and sensors to over 250
      people from 2008 onwards.

    "Without a doubt, the strong and close working relationship that exists
      between the University of Manchester and the Met Office was a significant
      benefit to the Met Office, the CAA, the aviation industry and the general
      public as it allowed swift state-of-the-art validation of model forecasts
      and satellite retrievals." Dr Jim Haywood, Met Office supporting
        letter [A]
    Context
    On April 14 2010, the eruption of Iceland's Eyafjallaj&amp;#246;kull volcano
      intensified and large quantities of ash began to be ejected into the
      atmosphere, reaching UK airspace on the morning of April 15. During this
      period, the Met Office's London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) was
      tasked with delivering information on affected regions of the atmosphere
      to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) using numerical dispersion
      modelling. As a result of these model predictions, the International Civil
      Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidance, based on a zero threshold for ash
      in air, was that it would no longer support service to commercial air
      traffic into the affected region. As a result of the impact on the
      industry, the VAAC predictions became the subject of intense scrutiny from
      the airlines and it became imperative to verify the accuracy of the
      forecasts.
    Pathways to Impact
    The Centre for Atmospheric Sciences has a long track record of developing
      ground based and airborne instruments for sensing aerosol and cloud
      properties and it has applied these to a wide range of atmospheric
      research problems over the last decade and more. This leading research has
      meant CAS hosts the aerosol and cloud physics measurement capability for
      the NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) on the FAAM
      aircraft in Manchester and was therefore central to the volcanic ash
      response during the eruption. The combination of the development of cloud
      physics probes and lidars and their application has placed this group as
      international leaders in the field and it is this research strength and
      experience that enabled the group to rapidly respond to the National Civil
      Emergency through the novel application of instrumentation and
      interpretation of the data and having the capability to develop the
      methods rapidly at the time of the crisis to apply them to a new research
      problem.
    Prior to the deployment of the FAAM aircraft for the response, the first
      British detection of the ash cloud over the UK was from Manchester's LiDAR
      system at Cardington on 15 April [B]. The data was immediately relayed to
      the Met Office's London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre. At the Capel Dewi
      field facility, the Raman and mobile DIAL lidars were operated by
      Manchester for NCAS [F] alongside a Met Office sun photometer to derive
      ash mass throughout the eruption. To verify the model predictions during
      the first week of the eruption, the NERC Dornier 228 aircraft was
      mobilised but initially did not have the measurement capability to detect
      ash particles. NERC asked Manchester's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences to
      install and operate its cloud physics probes for this purpose [F]. From
      April 16 until April 23 the Dornier flew five flights into the ash plume.
      These measurements provided initial verification of the Met Office model.
    During the first week of the eruption there was no safe operating limit
      for ash and therefore the no-fly zone was extensive, severely restricting
      air traffic. On April 20 the Civil Aviation (CAA), in cooperation with
      engine manufacturers and regulators, was able to agree new procedures
      which allowed flights into areas of ash with concentrations predicted by
      VAAC to be below 2000 03bcgm-3, with extended maintenance
      procedures to be applied for concentrations above 200 03bcgm-3.
      The CAA technical report [C] details how the technical basis for the
      decision was significantly influenced by the data from Manchester's Centre
      for Atmospheric Science (CAS) airborne and LiDAR measurements.
    The introduction of this safe operating limit set further challenges for
      the Met Office model, which from this point on needed to deliver accurate
      and verifiable ash mass forecasts. CAS performed intensive LiDAR
      monitoring from the Aberystwyth site throughout the period of the
      eruption. These measurements were used by the Met Office, in conjunction
      with its sun photometer, to deliver estimates of ash mass. This ultimately
      provided the main verification of the Met Office model, although as the
      methodology was indirect, direct measurements were still required to
      provide evidence that the approach was robust.
    The Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) had its
      aircraft operational by April 20 and flew five flights up until May 18.
      CAS, using the FAAM aircraft, delivered measurements of the size
      distribution of the ash particles and used this to develop a method with
      the Met Office of assessing ash mass. This data, coupled with shape
      analysis delivered by analysis of ash on filters by the Manchester
      researchers, was used to confirm the assumptions made using the ground
      based and satellite remote sensing retrievals of ash mass and so verify
      the Met Office model development. This work increased the model
      reliability and the CAA was able to vastly reduce the region of closed
      airspace, allowing commercial air traffic around northern Europe to be
      effectively re-routed and to return to near full operation.
    Reach and Significance
    Manchester data saves airline industry billions
    The ability of CAS to rapidly respond and provide robust verification,
      allowed policy change to be implemented quickly, leading to a reduction in
      the number of days affected, the total financial losses and also
      disruption to the lives of UK nationals at home and overseas. The shutdown
      of airspace was estimated to cost the airline industry worldwide $400m per
      day at the height of the closures and caused a total loss of revenue to
      the industry of $1.7bn [D]. From April 20 onwards, the new procedures had
      the immediate effect of re-opening airspace and it remained substantially
      open up to the end of the eruption around 21 May except for a brief and
      predicted period between 3 and 5 May. It can be estimated that the
      implementation of the new ash thresholds produced a saving of up to $10bn
      to the global airline industry, based on extrapolating the average daily
      financial losses during the first 6 days before the new thresholds were
      introduced throughout the remaining active phase of the eruption. The
      University of Manchester measurements played a vital role by providing the
      Met Office with verification of their forecast model to allow such a
      threshold to be implemented.
    Manchester team advises Government
    Throughout this time Manchester provided advice directly to the
      Government as Professor Coe was a member of the Government Office for
      Science's Scientific Advisory Group in Emergencies (SAGE), which reported
      through the Chief Scientist to COBRA and the Cabinet Office throughout and
      following the event [E]. SAGE advised the Government of the issues and
      risks surrounding the on-going volcanic ash event, the necessary
      predictive capability at the time and in the future and sought to
      establish the risk of future events. Since June 2012, the responsibility
      for reviewing volcanic ash threat on behalf of the Government has passed
      to the Volcanic Ash Observation Review Group (VAORG), which reports to the
      Department for Transport. Professors Vaughan and Coe are members of VAORG.
      Professor Vaughan has also advised the Met Office on the specification of
      their lidar network and is evaluating the tenders as an external advisor.
    Manchester measurement capability taken up by Met Office Volcano
        Response Aircraft Facility
    An outcome of the SAGE reports was the need for a ground based lidar
      network and an airborne volcano response facility that was capable of
      delivering a similar response to that provided by the FAAM aircraft on a
      continuous, year on year basis. The Met Office has taken on this role and
      commissioned lidars and an aircraft for the purpose. The technologies
      employed are exactly those supplied by Manchester during the response and
      the developed capability is now being maintained operationally should
      further eruptions affect airspace over the UK VAAC region [A].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Technology developed at UoM on clouds and aerosols proved vital in
      deriving ash mass concentrations during the 2010 eruption of the Iceland
      volcano, verifying the Met Office model that was defining the airspace
      exclusion zone and predict ash loadings for the Civil Aviation Authority.
      The shutdown of airspace cost the airline industry worldwide an estimated
      $1.7bn, reaching $400m per day on April 19th. Reassurance
      provided by our verification allowed lifting of flight restrictions which
      had the immediate effect of re-opening airspace, relieving the impact on
      hundreds of thousands of people globally, leading to an estimated global
      saving to the industry of $10bn The approach has resulted in new long term
      airborne response capability at the Met Office.

    This research took place at The Centre for Atmospheric Sciences,
      University of Manchester since 2003. The key researchers were:
    Professor Martin Gallagher (1993-) Professor of Atmospheric Physics
    Dr Keith Bower (1993-) Senior Research Fellow
    Professor Hugh Coe (1997-) Professor of Atmospheric Composition
    Dr James Dorsey (2000-) Research Fellow

    Professor Geraint Vaughan (2005-) Professor of Atmospheric Science
    Over the past decade, research at Manchester's Centre for Atmospheric
      Sciences has established world-leading capability in measuring and
      interpreting cloud and aerosol properties from ground- based and airborne
      platforms. This was augmented by further research [4, 6] during the
      Eyafyallaj&amp;#246;kull eruption to address specific challenges relevant to ash
      detection. Key findings/insights were:
    
      Better calibration techniques for cloud particle imager probes. These
        have enabled more accurate measurement of the sizes of cloud particles
        and improved our ability to image them correctly. For example, as cloud
        particles move through the imaging region their images may become
        blurred, leading to mis-sizing. Our work has developed methods for
        correcting and improving protocols for using these probes [1].
      Improved analysis and interpretation methods for mixed-phase cloud
        data. Our team has developed improved ways of processing cloud
        microphysics data through efficient computational data analysis and the
        combination of very large, multi-dimensional data sets to more
        rigorously probe cloud microphysical phenomena from airborne platforms,
        as first evidenced during the EMERALD experiment [2]. These methods have
        been rigorously optimised and validated using cloud nucleation
        experiments at the EU AIDA large chamber facility e.g. [3].
      Derivation of ash mass from airborne measurements during the
        Eyafyallaj&amp;#246;kull eruption using cloud microphysics probes. During the
        volcanic eruption, we deployed our cloud microphysics probes to measure
        ash particles. Ash has very different densities and refractive indices
        to cloud water or ice and our research during the eruption showed that
        the probes were capable of delivering reliable ash mass loading, which
        we validated using off-line analysis of filter samples [4].
      Development of Raman LiDAR to measure aerosols and water vapour in the
        troposphere, in collaboration with European colleagues, and the
        application of Raman lidar measurements together with wind profiling
        radars to study atmospheric processes [5].
      A method of deriving ash mass continuously using a combination of
        LiDAR and sun photometer. This research, conducted during the eruption,
        used the expertise developed by the Manchester LIDAR group, to provide a
        retrieval of the ash mass as a function of altitude [6]. Our work also
        showed that exploiting the ability of Raman LiDAR to separate
        measurements of optical depth and backscatter of the ash was
        particularly important in determining detailed measurements of particle
        properties.

Consequently, new materials can only be applied once an&#xD;      appropriate joining technique has been developed. A step forward for new&#xD;      disk materials such as powder-processed nickel base superalloys is to&#xD;      transfer from fusion to solid state welding techniques, such as inertia&#xD;      and linear friction welding.&#xD;    Pathways to Impact&#xD;    The research carried out in Manchester contributed to developing inertia&#xD;      and linear friction welding parameters in order to join powder processed&#xD;      nickel-base superalloys, high strength dissimilar steels and an advanced&#xD;      Titanium alloy. Detailed microstructure and residual stress analysis&#xD;      provided a new understanding of the welding processes, which in return&#xD;      provided guidance in developing parameters with researchers directly&#xD;      involved in the parameter development by participating in welding trials&#xD;      carried out in the USA. The fundamental research upon inertia welding was&#xD;      funded originally by the EPSRC (1999-2002, &amp;#163;145k). Translation of this&#xD;      research for application by Rolls-Royce in aeroengines has been provided&#xD;      though a number of projects of over the period 2002-2011 with a value&#xD;      &amp;#163;750k, funded from a number of different sources that include the DTI, TSB&#xD;      and Rolls-Royce.&#xD;    Reach and Significance&#xD;    Many friction welding combinations that were studied are now employed in&#xD;      modern aeroengines developed by Rolls-Royce. For instance, inertia&#xD;      friction welding of nickel base superalloys has been used in the Trent&#xD;      900, which powers the A380. The number of friction welds has further&#xD;      increased in the Trent 1000 (entry into service in 2010) for the Boeing&#xD;      787. The Trent XWB engine (maiden flight in 2013) that powers the A350&#xD;      Airbus will again see the introduction of additional friction welds where&#xD;      University of Manchester contributed by undertaking detailed&#xD;      microstructural and residual stress analysis. The Trent XWB was&#xD;      custom-designed for the A350, and the A350 with the XWB engines provide a&#xD;      25% step-change in fuel efficiency compared to its current long-range&#xD;      competitor [A]. More than 1,200 of these engines have so far been ordered&#xD;      [B]. It was announced in April 2013 that the parent company of British&#xD;      Airways, International Airlines Group had placed an order with Rolls-Royce&#xD;      for more than &amp;#163;1 bn for Trent XWB engines to power a fleet of 18 Airbus&#xD;      A350-1000 aircraft, along with an option to buy engines for a further 18&#xD;      [C].&#xD;    The implementation of these friction welds allows Rolls-Royce to use new&#xD;      high temperature materials (RR1000), as well as novel material&#xD;      combinations. As a consequence, the engines can operate at a higher&#xD;      temperature than previous engines with material that has about a 50 f0b0C&#xD;      higher temperature capability than previous alloys. The result of this is&#xD;      that Rolls-Royce has been able to develop new engines with improved fuel&#xD;      efficiency. By enabling the operating temperature to be increased, there&#xD;      are also subsequent benefits in terms of NOx and CO2&#xD;      fuel emissions.&#xD;    In addition, research has enabled blisk technology, which has delivered&#xD;      up to 30% weight saving on critical rotating components. The capability to&#xD;      join materials without the requirement for mechanical joints (such as&#xD;      bolts) has also enabled the development of novel engine architectures.&#xD;      This gives benefits in terms of SFC and has also enabled Rolls-Royce plc&#xD;      to maintain market share as they are able to offer this technology to&#xD;      their customers. All of these aspects are crucial for Rolls-Royce in order&#xD;      to maintain competitive advantage and compete in the global market [D].&#xD;    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;    Research at the University of Manchester has supported the development of&#xD;      inertia and linear friction welding of high temperature materials for&#xD;      aeroengine application. The research has guided process parameter&#xD;      development and led to deployment of these new welding techniques at&#xD;      Rolls-Royce plc. In particular, inertia friction welding is now used in&#xD;      modern gas turbine engines, such as the Trent 900, which powers the A380,&#xD;      Trent 1000 for the Boeing 787 and Trent XWB for the Airbus A350. In&#xD;      addition, research has enabled blisk technology (welding of blades on&#xD;      disks), which has delivered up to 30% weight saving on critical rotating&#xD;      components.&#xD;    </ImpactSummary><ImpactType>Technological</ImpactType><Institution>&#xD;    University of Manchester&#xD;    </Institution><Institutions><HEI><AlternativeName>Manchester (University of)</AlternativeName><InstitutionName>University of Manchester</InstitutionName><PeerGroup>65</PeerGroup><Region>North West</Region><UKPRN>10007798</UKPRN></HEI></Institutions><Panel>B         </Panel><PlaceName/><References>&#xD;    The research has been published in leading international journals such as&#xD;      Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A and contributed to the award of&#xD;      a number of prizes to the academic staff involved.

In 2003, Dr Preuss became a Lecturer at&#xD;      the UoM and continued to lead this research area with support from Prof.&#xD;      Withers.&#xD;    Drs M Karadge (2005-2009) and M Attallah (2008-2010) also worked as PDRAs&#xD;      on the project.&#xD;    Dr R Moat became involved in the research activity as an MSc student&#xD;      (2005) and continued to undertake research in the area during his PhD&#xD;      studies (2006-10).&#xD;    Detailed residual stress and microstructure analysis was carried out&#xD;      between 1999 and 2010 using large-scale research facilities and advanced&#xD;      microscopy to identify the role of welding process parameters and&#xD;      subsequent post-weld heat treatments on the integrity and performance of&#xD;      inertia and linear friction welded aeroengine materials. One of the main&#xD;      challenges was to minimise residual stresses by either identifying optimum&#xD;      welding parameters or applying an appropriate post weld heat treatment&#xD;      that relaxes the stresses sufficiently without compromising the&#xD;      microstructures and properties of the component. The research has&#xD;      progressed through a number of significant advances:&#xD;    &#xD;       We showed that residual stresses could be measured reliably, using&#xD;        neutron diffraction [1]. These measurements also highlighted that hole&#xD;        drilling measurements, usually used by Rolls-Royce, do not probe the&#xD;        regions where the most detrimental tensile stresses are observed [1].&#xD;        Residual stress analysis demonstrated that the proposed post weld heat&#xD;        treatment does not relief the stresses sufficiently and an alternative&#xD;        heat treatment temperature was proposed [1].&#xD;       The microstructure analysis demonstrated that the welding process&#xD;        generates a microstructure in the weld region with superior strength&#xD;        than the base material and that the increased post weld heat treatment&#xD;        temperature to relieve residual stresses has minimal impact on the&#xD;        performance of the material [2].&#xD;       We also demonstrated the pronounced effect of alloy chemistry on&#xD;        residual stress generation during inertia friction welding of nickel&#xD;        base superalloys [3].&#xD;       The work then also expanded in inertia friction welding dissimilar&#xD;        steels for engine shaft applications, highlighting issues related to the&#xD;        ineffectiveness of the proposed post-weld heat treatment procedures [4]&#xD;        and complex microstructure and hardness variations in those welds [5].&#xD;       We expanded into the field of linear friction welding [6], which is a&#xD;        key application for the development of blisks as it enables one to weld&#xD;        blades on disks.&#xD;    &#xD;    </UnderpinningResearch></CaseStudyDump><CaseStudyDump><CaseStudyId>28169</CaseStudyId><Continent><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>6255148</GeoNamesId><Name>Europe</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>6255149</GeoNamesId><Name>North America</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>6255147</GeoNamesId><Name>Asia</Name></GeoLocation></Continent><Country><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>2921044</GeoNamesId><Name>Germany</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>3017382</GeoNamesId><Name>France</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>1861060</GeoNamesId><Name>Japan</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>2635167</GeoNamesId><Name>United Kingdom</Name></GeoLocation><GeoLocation><GeoNamesId>6252001</GeoNamesId><Name>United States</Name></GeoLocation></Country><Funders xmlns:a="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/Arrays"><a:string>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</a:string></Funders><ImpactDetails>&#xD;
    Context&#xD;
    Mars Drinks is the drinks division of Mars Incorporated, a global company&#xD;
      with a turnover of over $33bn in Petcare, Chocolate, Wrigley, Food, Drinks&#xD;
      and Symbioscience. Mars Drinks was established in 1955, originally as the&#xD;
      Four Square Division of Mars, and now employs more than 650 Associates&#xD;
      across eight countries. Operating in the UK, France, Germany, USA and&#xD;
      Japan, Mars Drinks have their drinks machines in over 35,000 businesses&#xD;
      and produce more than one billion drinks a year with their two brands: Flavia&#xD;
      single portion fresh beverages; and Klix in-cup beverages [A]. A&#xD;
      conservative estimate would value sales at &amp;gt; US$400m per annum.&#xD;
      Polymers are used widely in the field of food packaging in the Mars group&#xD;
      and the Klix and Flavia both rely upon the performance of&#xD;
      their polymeric packaging and cups during the vending process.&#xD;
      Collaboration with the University of Manchester over many years has&#xD;
      enabled robust systems to be put in place to enable cost-effective and&#xD;
      reliable polymer-based systems to be specified. Since both types of drinks&#xD;
      are produced at the level of hundreds of millions per year, this gives&#xD;
      major challenges in terms of materials processing, performance, and&#xD;
      quality control.&#xD;
    Pathways to Impact&#xD;
    The impact of the contribution of UoM to this project has been through&#xD;
      the evaluation of materials performance, quality control, trouble shooting&#xD;
      and helping direct materials specification. This has been undertaken&#xD;
      though Mars-funded research projects (&amp;#163;0.45 million over the 20-year&#xD;
      period) with the Manchester researchers working closely with the company&#xD;
      and with their suppliers, and spending time at the company premises.&#xD;
    Reach&#xD;
    Flavia freshly-vended drinks&#xD;
    A major achievement over the past 20 year period has been the&#xD;
      introduction of Flavia, which was originally only a European product, into&#xD;
      the export markets and more than double sales volumes [A]. Research&#xD;
      undertaken in the University of Manchester has had significant impact upon&#xD;
      the development of this product. Heat-sealing of the different&#xD;
      polypropylene components has been a major challenge and the fundamental&#xD;
      research undertaken upon the melting and crystallisation of polypropylene&#xD;
      has led to a detailed specification of the properties needed in the&#xD;
      different polypropylene components to produce a robust and reliable&#xD;
      system. For example, the problem of side bursts has now been reduced by&#xD;
      three orders of magnitude and so virtually eliminated. Consequently the Flavia&#xD;
      single portion fresh beverage system has revolutionised the delivery of&#xD;
      refreshments in the office environment. It is a simple to use, convenient,&#xD;
      clean and reliable drinks system that has replaced the "office coffee pot"&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
    Klix instant drinks&#xD;
    The Klix system is now used widely in public spaces such as at&#xD;
      colleges and in factories, delivering a range of branded drinks, both&#xD;
      reliably and with consistent quality. The research at the University of&#xD;
      Manchester upon the material used in the Klix cups has been of&#xD;
      major significance in the development of the system. Topics studied have&#xD;
      included polymer blends, rubber toughening, thermal conductivity and&#xD;
      recycling. A specific example of impact was in solving the problem of&#xD;
      environmental stress cracking (ESC) in the high-impact polystyrene (HIPS)&#xD;
      cups used in the Klix system &amp;#8212; a potential safety hazard.&#xD;
      Polystyrene is susceptible to ESC in the presence of the fats in dairy&#xD;
      products. This was found to be a particular issue for the Klix&#xD;
      system with milky drinks such as drinking chocolate or white coffee. It&#xD;
      was demonstrated that the ESC problem resulted from the size and form of&#xD;
      the rubber particles in the grade of HIPS employed in the presence of&#xD;
      dairy products. The relatively small rubber particles in HIPS were&#xD;
      susceptible to damage during processing that reduced their effective size&#xD;
      further. It was found that the ESC problem could be overcome by specifying&#xD;
      a different grade of HIPS with larger rubber particles.&#xD;
    Significance&#xD;
    The underpinning research with the University of Manchester, that has led&#xD;
      to the development of the present Klix and Flavia drinks&#xD;
      systems has been a central and necessary component in the success of Mars&#xD;
      Drinks [A] through:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Better materials selection&#xD;
      Improved quality control&#xD;
      Improvements in packaging performance&#xD;
      Significant cost reduction&#xD;
    &#xD;
    One particular problem that was encountered before the collaboration with&#xD;
      the University of Manchester was that the polymer-based components in Flavia&#xD;
      and Klix were poorly specified in terms of their structure and&#xD;
      properties, which meant that company was susceptible to changes in grades&#xD;
      of polymer by their suppliers. This research has had significant impact in&#xD;
      the areas of materials selection and quality control, coupled with an&#xD;
      improvement in performance and an associated significant cost reduction.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Research at the University of Manchester has supported the development of&#xD;
      drinks vending systems for Mars Drinks. The research has demonstrated that&#xD;
      a detailed understanding of the relationship between the structure and&#xD;
      properties of the polymeric components is vital for the design and&#xD;
      performance of two drinks vending systems, Flavia (single-portion&#xD;
      fresh beverages) and Klix (in-cup beverages). This research has&#xD;
      contributed to major improvements in materials selection, quality control,&#xD;
      cost reduction and performance. These drinks vending systems were&#xD;
      developed originally in the UK in collaboration with the University of&#xD;
      Manchester, with Flavia now also manufactured in the USA and&#xD;
      marketed worldwide by Mars Drinks with an estimated sales value of &amp;gt;&#xD;
      US$400m per annum.&#xD;

    The research was undertaken by:&#xD;
    Professor Young throughout the period 1994-2013.&#xD;
    Dr Patrick Fairclough (PDRA, 1995-97).&#xD;
    Additional research students included William O'Kane (1993-1997), Craig&#xD;
      Meakin (1997-2001), Masakazu Tanaka (2001-2005) and Sylvain Rannou&#xD;
      (2005-2009).&#xD;
    The underpinning research has been undertaken though an EPSRC and&#xD;
      Mars-supported research programme in Manchester over the past 20 years.&#xD;
      Findings that have contributed to the impact in this area include:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      
Rapid crystallisation processes in polymer films [1,2].&#xD;
        Combined SAXS/WAXS on the Daresbury synchrotron was used to investigate&#xD;
        the mechanism for primary nucleation in polymer crystallization [2] as&#xD;
        previous research in this area had not been conclusive. Experiments on&#xD;
        polypropylene with long induction times, studied by small- and&#xD;
        wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), revealed the onset of&#xD;
        long-range ordering prior to crystal growth. Rapid crystallization&#xD;
        studied by melt extrusion indicated the development of well-resolved&#xD;
        oriented SAXS patterns associated with long-range order before the&#xD;
        development of crystalline peaks in the WAXS region. This highly-cited&#xD;
        research has led to a completely new insight into polypropylene&#xD;
        crystallisation that has enabled the rapid heat-sealing process in the&#xD;
        polypropylene films to be understood and fully characterised.&#xD;
      
Characterisation of molecular orientation in polymer films&#xD;
        [3-5]. The properties of polymer films depend vitally upon the degree of&#xD;
        molecular orientation in the film. Polarised Raman spectroscopy is a&#xD;
        vibrational spectroscopic technique that is used widely for the chemical&#xD;
        and physical analyses of materials since it is both non-destructive and&#xD;
        suitable for remote analysis. Compared to other analytical techniques,&#xD;
        polarised Raman spectroscopy has the following advantages, (1)&#xD;
        quantitative and precise measurement of molecular orientation&#xD;
        distributions, and (2) study of these distributions in both the&#xD;
        crystalline and amorphous phases. It has been demonstrated that it is a&#xD;
        relatively rapid non-destructive technique that allows the properties of&#xD;
        polymer films to be characterised and related to their mechanical&#xD;
        performance.&#xD;
      
Environmental stress cracking in high-impact polystyrene [6].&#xD;
        Polystyrene is a widely used polymer but is susceptible to environmental&#xD;
        stress cracking (ESC) in the presence of the fats in dairy products. It&#xD;
        was found that high-impact polystyrene with large rubber particles gave&#xD;
        the best ESC resistance [6]. Moreover it was shown that processing of&#xD;
        the polymer into flat sheets by extrusion tends to damage and reduce the&#xD;
        size of the rubber particles, worsening the ESC resistance. It was&#xD;
        demonstrated that the appropriate choice of materials and processing&#xD;
        conditions enables the production of samples of polystyrene with improve&#xD;

    The production of graphene and subsequent characterisation of
      extraordinary thermal, electron transport, mechanical and gas-barrier
      properties, together with high specific surface area, led to the
      realisation it could be used in potentially disruptive technologies. The
      opportunities span an incredibly broad range of applications, including
      printed electronics, new transistors, super capacitors, transparent
      conductors, biomedical sensors, automotive batteries, and composites and
      coatings with enhanced mechanical and electrical performance. Companies
      have moved rapidly to exploit this potential, with significant investment
      in both new and existing businesses, new jobs and the first graphene-based
      products reaching the market. Alongside these economic impacts, there have
      been significant public policy impacts, with substantial shifts globally
      in science and innovation budgets.
    ECONOMIC IMPACTS
    It has been estimated [A] that by 2010, 210 companies globally had made
      significant corporate investments in bringing graphene and graphene-based
      products to market &amp;#8212; 88 between 2008-10 in the US, Japan, Korea, Germany,
      UK and China. This activity covers three broad sectors: graphene
      production, graphene-based technologies, and graphene-based products.
    Graphene Production: Demand for graphene has grown rapidly,
      prompting investment in scaling up and reducing the cost of production.
      Total graphene output in 2009 was 12 tons, rising to 155-205 tons in 2013
      [B (ii)], with a market value of around $10 million. Over 55 companies
      have entered the sector, with at least 24 formed since 2008. It was
      estimated in 2011 that there was already $40M invested in small graphene
      producers [B (iii)]. During the past two years there has been significant
      investment in scaling up production. As examples: XG Sciences (revenues of
      $4 million in 2012) have invested $10.5 million to scale-up production
      from 3 tons to 80 tons pa with staff numbers increasing from 8 to 30
      between 2010-12 [C]; Ningbo Morsh Technology have invested $30 million in
      a 300 ton pa production line in Zheijian Province, China [D]; and Garmor
      Inc have invested in a 100-ton pa facility in Orlando, with plans to
      employ 80-100 employees over 5 years [E]. Although financial data is not
      available for all 55 companies active in the field, these three alone
      account for recent investments of around $50m, leading to a conservative
      estimate of at least $200m invested in scaling-up production capacity.
    Graphene-based Technologies: Several large multinational
      companies are known to be active in developing graphene-based
      technologies, including IBM, Samsung, BASF, Nokia, Sandisk, and Fujitsu
      [B, F, G]. Although details of the financial investments involved are not
      available, the scale of activity from these companies can be judged by the
      volume of associated graphene-related patents. Between 2008-12 7740
      patents were published, roughly half by the corporate sector [G].
      Continuing investment is exemplified by the 33% growth in the patent
      family portfolios of the top corporates in the field since 2010.
    Graphene-based Products: Graphene-based products have begun
      to reach the market, for example: HEAD graphene composite tennis racquets,
      Vorbeck conductive inks, Powerbooster touchscreens, Ovation Polymers
      ExTimaTM graphene/polymer masterbatch compounds, Bluestone Grat-PowerTM
      SiGP graphene-enhanced anode materials, and Cabot LITX G700 graphene-based
      battery additive. Although it can be difficult to obtain commercially
      sensitive financial information on the investments needed to bring
      products to market or the resulting sales, we provide three illustrative
      examples:
    
      HEAD has an established reputation in hi-tech sports equipment. In
        2012, they brought to market a range of graphene-reinforced-composite
        racquets, exploiting the high specific bonding area characteristics of
        graphene to achieve a significant advance in strength-to-weight ratio
        [H]. This allowed the weight of the mid-section of the racquet to be
        reduced, leading to significant improvements in handling. By late June
        2013, the company reported they were on course to sell 200k graphene
        racquets in 2013 [H]. Retailing for around $150, this equates to a sales
        value of $30m, at least half of which is likely to have been in the REF
        period. It is also noted that sales of graphene-based racquets are
        displacing other racquets that the company markets [H].
      Shanghai-based Powerbooster, working with graphene producers,
        Bluestone Global Tech, are manufacturing graphene-based touch screens.
        In a June 2013 online interview with the Wall Street Journal, they
        reported monthly sales of 2m screens, which translate to revenues of
        roughly $10m per month [I].
      Vorbeck Materials introduced Vor-inkTM, graphene-based
        conductive ink for printed electronics in 2009. With MeadWestvaco, a
        global packaging company, they developed a printed anti-theft packaging
        system that is now used by major US retailers including Home Depot and
        CVS [J], generating annual revenues for Vorbeck of $1m-$2.4m [K]. To
        meet customer demand for Vor-inkTM, Vorbeck invested in
        real-estate and equipment in 2012 to increase their production capacity
        to over 40 tons pa, with further investment in a new production facility
        opening in late 2013 [L].
    
    POLICY IMPACTS
    The isolation and characterisation of graphene also led to significant
      shifts in science funding policy, with major public investments in
      graphene research and commercialisation around the globe. A 2011 survey of
      European funding for graphene-related R&amp;amp;D found significant funding in
      26 countries, with major priority progammes in 7 [M]. In total, European
      national funding in the period 2008-11 was &amp;#8364;177m, compared to &amp;#8364;2.5m before
      2008, with the European Commission providing &amp;#8364;87m over the same period. In
      Jan 2013, the Commission announced a further &amp;#8364;1000m investment over ten
      years in a graphene Future and Emerging Technologies Flagship Initiative.
      In the USA, the National Science Foundation awarded around $200m in the
      period 2008-12 [N]. In Asia, South Korea is reported to be spending more
      than $350m on graphene commercialisation initiatives [B(ii),O]; the
      National University of Singapore invested $31M in a Graphene Research
      Center in 2010, attracting $47M support from the National Research
      Foundation a year later [P]; and China invested $81m in government funds
      between 2002-2012, on a rapidly rising trajectory [Q]. Cumulatively, these
      initiatives represent a seismic shift in public funding for science, with
      at least $2.4bn committed to date.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The isolation and characterisation of graphene by Geim and Novoselov
      demonstrated its potential to underpin disruptive technological change
      across an incredibly broad range of industries. This resulted in rapid
      global uptake of new technologies in the REF period, with at least $200m
      recent commercial investment in graphene production. Blue-chip companies
      have also made significant investments leading to the generation of 7740
      industrial patents. The first set of graphene-based products has reached
      the market with revenues already exceeding $10m per month. This commercial
      activity has been matched by global shifts in public research and
      innovation funding of at least $2.4bn, as governments have moved to
      facilitate graphene research and commercialisation.

    Research on properties of thin materials was initiated in the UoA in
      2001, and resulted in the discovery of a new class of materials &amp;#8212;
      free-standing two-dimensional crystals, including single layers of
      graphite, boron nitride, several dichalcogenides and complex oxides &amp;#8212; by
      key researchers, Andre Geim (in post 1999 onwards) and Konstantin
      Novoselov (in post 2001 onwards). Unexpectedly, these atomically thin
      sheets (essentially gigantic 2D molecules unprotected from the immediate
      environment) are stable under ambient conditions, exhibit high crystal
      quality and are continuous on a macroscopic scale. The isolation and
      characterisation of monolayers of graphite, an allotrope of carbon known
      as graphene, have opened pathways for a range of applications. Amongst the
      many research findings are the demonstrations of:
    
      The feasibility of working with atomically thin films, including metal
        dichalcogenides, boron nitride and complex oxides and freestanding
        graphene films [1,2], opening up countless possibilities for many new
        applications and devices.
      The electric field effect in graphene films [1], showing that
        transistor operation based on graphene is possible.
      The relativistic behaviour of charge carriers in graphene [3] and of a
        new kind of Quantum Hall Effect [4], observations of fundamental
        importance for science.
      The feasibility of graphene as electrodes in liquid crystal devices
        [5], demonstrating further the practicality of the use of graphene in
        electronics.
      The observation of fast spin currents in graphene [6], showing that
        potential for spintronics replacement of electronics for data processing
        and transfer.

    The Exhibitions
    The Royal Society's annual Summer Science Exhibition showcases the most
      exciting cutting-edge
      science and technology research [A]. It provides a unique opportunity for
      members of the public to
      interact with scientists and ask them questions about their work. The
      Exhibition is the Society's
      main public event of the year, and is open to members of the general
      public as well as students
      and teachers, scientists, policymakers and the media [A]. The exhibitions
      have taken place
      annually since 1778, and are widely regarded as the UK's premier public
      engagement event in
      science. Our increased participation during the REF period reflects a
      strategic decision by the UoA
      to target this event as a vehicle for optimum science communication,
      drawing systematically on our
      most exciting and ambitious research. Part of this strategy is to reuse
      resources produced for the
      Exhibits building a lasting legacy on the initial development. Since 2008,
      we have led or played a
      major (50%) role in 4 exhibits:
    AO: ALMA Observatory &amp;#8212; probing our cosmic
          origins with ALMA (6 days, 2012) developed in
      collaboration with Cambridge and led in Manchester by Avison (RA), with
      UoM providing about half
      the exhibition team (6 staff, 3 PhD students).
    SF: Putting sunshine in the tank &amp;#8212; using
          nanotechnology to make solar fuel (6 days, 2011)
      led by UoM (PI Flavell, staff), a collaboration with York, Nottingham and
      East Anglia. UoM
      provided over half the team of 23 staff, RAs and PhDs.
    GR: Carbon Flatland &amp;#8212; unexpected science in a
          pencil line (6 days, 2011) has exhibit team of
      30 from various UoM Schools including Physics and Astronomy (including
      Novoselov, staff).
    LC: Liquid crystals: living cells and flat
          screen TVs (10 days, 2010) was led in Manchester by
      Dierking (staff) and Gleeson (staff), and in collaboration with
      Southampton, York and Sheffield
      Hallam. The exhibit was largely built in Manchester.
    We have also made significant contributions (ca. 15-30%) to a
      further 4 exhibits in the period:
    PL: Planck: Looking back to the dawn of time
      (7 days, 2013). A collaboration with Imperial
      College, the Cambridge, Oxford and Cardiff. UoM RAs Watson and Peel
      designed and built part of
      the stand; 8 UoM staff, RAs and PGs made up 20% of the exhibit team.
    HB: Higgs Boson &amp;#8212; understanding the Higgs
          Boson (7 days, 2013). A collaboration of 17 UK
      universities and RAL. The UoM team was led by Soldner-Rembold (staff) with
      4 PDRAs/PGs; UoM
      provided prizes (books signed by Cox (staff)), and part of an online
      booklet.
    HP: From the oldest light to the youngest
          stars: the Herschel and Planck Missions' (5 days,
      2009) A collaboration with Cardiff, Cambridge, Imperial College, the
      Mullard Space Science
      Laboratory, RAL and UK ATC, with Lowe (RA) leading for UoM.
    NW: Is there anybody out there? Looking for
          new worlds (4 days, 2008) With the Open
      University, QUB, St Andrews, Hertfordshire, Keele and The Faulkes
      Telescope Project. Our
      contribution on microlensing was led by Rattenbury (RA).
    Selection and Preparation
    Seven of the exhibits were selected by the Royal Society via a
      competitive process &amp;#8212; e.g. the solar
      fuel exhibit (SF) was one of 21 exhibits selected from 97
      applications. Selection criteria included
      the quality of the underpinning research, and track record in public
      engagement. The graphene
      exhibit (GR) was by invitation following the award of the 2010
      Nobel Prize in Physics. Significant
      funds were raised from external bodies to enhance a number of the
      exhibits, for example SF
      benefitted from a &amp;#163;46k EPSRC `Pathways to Impact' award, enabling
      construction of a solar fuel
      demonstrator. Seven of the exhibits were staged at Carlton House Terrace (NW,
      HP, SF, GR, AO,
      HB, PL). The 2010 exhibit, LC, was part of a Festival of
      Science and Arts, held at London's
      Southbank Centre in celebration of the Society's 350th anniversary.
    Impact on Visitors to the Exhibits
    In total, the eight exhibits received more than 94,000 visitors. Those at
      the Royal Society saw
      between 5,000-14,000 visitors each, while the 2010 anniversary exhibition
      received almost 50,000
      visitors [C]. As a typical breakdown of these visitors, the 2011
      exhibition (SF, GR) was attended by
      around 14,000 visitors made up of GCSE and A-level students (1852, from 92
      schools and
      colleges), teachers (224), representatives of the media (45), FRS/VIP
      guests (1425) and other
      members of the public (10265). The school visitors were gender balanced,
      54% white ethnic and
      86% from non-independent schools; 91% agreed they enjoyed talking to the
      scientists [C].
    Captivating and enthralling hands-on demonstrations were developed for
      all exhibits. As illustrative
      examples, these included (for LC) displays of the beautiful
      iridescence of chiral liquid crystals in
      temperature sensing devices and on the backs of bugs, and visitors were
      amazed to see dramatic
      changes when viewed with polarizing light. Members of the public made
      liquid crystals undergo
      phase transitions and saw their response to electric and magnetic fields.
      At SF, visitors were able
      to make quantum dots luminesce, operate a solar nanocell, producing
      hydrogen at the stand, and
      race solar-fuel-powered model cars against the solar-powered equivalent
      using our solar-powered
      Scalextrix. At GR, visitors were able to make graphene themselves
      using sellotape, and their
      samples were examined by optical microscopy to confirm that graphene had
      been made &amp;#8212; an
      achievement that resulted in the award of a chocolate Nobel Prize medal
      and badge. At PL,
      visitors were able to use a telephone to dial up the sound of the Big
      Bang. Typically 60-75% of
      student visitors felt that the exhibition had made them more interested in
      science, and more
      interested in the possibility of a science-based career [C].
    Impact on Virtual Visitors &amp;#8212; Web Resources and Media Coverage
    Alongside each exhibit, significant web-based resources were developed,
      all of which have a life
      after the exhibition. These included the exhibit web sites (which remain
      live and active [A]) and (for
      the later exhibits) blogs, handouts/booklets (e.g. HB [B]),
      factsheets (e.g. HP, NW), materials for
      teachers (e.g. LC [D]), videos and an Ask the Scientist
      question and answer forum, live during the
      exhibition. As examples, in 2013 (PL, HB), the main exhibition
      website was visited 113,630 times
      [C] and the 2011 main site (SF, GR) has been shared on over 3400
      social networking sites.
    The web-based resources developed during each exhibition have contributed
      significantly to our
      ongoing public engagement activities. For example, web-based interactive
      games and quizzes
      designed for the SF exhibit (allowing the player to make enough
      solar fuel to launch a rocket) have
      been played over 4,500 times (and reused on the UoM website), while a
      linked YouTube video has
      more than 18,500 views. A graphene virtual microscope iPhone app (GR)
      has now been
      downloaded over 10,000 times from Google Play and iTunes. One of the key
      elements of HP was
      the Chromoscope software tool to explore multi-wavelength views of
      the Universe (lead developer
      Lowe, RA). This has been used since in exhibitions including the Big Bang
      Fair Manchester in
      2010 (22,000 visitors), and was developed into a web-based application [E]
      which had around 1.5
      million users in its first year. It has also been incorporated into a
      popular `touchtable' exhibit that
      has been in use at Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre (JBDC) since it opened in
      2011 [F], receiving
      more than 235,000 visitors. A major feature of AO was the Pynterferometer,
      a piece of interactive
      software which allowed exhibition-goers to use a touchscreen to drag
      `antennas' around and
      investigate how this affects the output of a telescope. This has led to a
      publication [G], is available
      for download, and is being developed further for display at JBDC.
    Significant media coverage was generated during and after each exhibit.
      This included BBC news
      coverage (TV [H] and website [I]), numerous blogs (such as Climate
        Change for Obama, SF [J])
      and many specialist magazines including The Engineer and Business
        Weekly.
    The Legacy &amp;#8212; Sustained Public Engagement
    Following each exhibit, we have received a substantial number of requests
      to participate in follow-on
      activity, in the UK and elsewhere. As an example, the graphene exhibit (GR)
      has been
      subsequently in action at the Manchester Science Festival (MSF) 2011, 2012
      and 2013, during
      National Science and Engineering Week (NSEW) 2012 and 2013, at Jodrell
        Bank Live (JBL) 2012
      and 2013 (a science exhibition/rock concert, 11,000 visitors in 2012), in
      3 Meet the Scientist events
      at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry, and at graphene EU
      flagship promotion
      events, such as the Graphene 2012 International Conference in Brussels (10th-13th
      April 2012).
      The latter was attended by 600 researchers, industrialists, policymakers
      and investors. More
      generally the exhibits have been in demand at large venues such as JBL,
      MSF, NSEW and Big
      Bang, London (LC, 30,000 visitors) but also in smaller events
      targeting `difficult to reach groups',
      for example, the solar-powered Scalextrix from SF was a highlight
      of Revolution &amp;#8212; a fun day in
      Ancoats, an inner city area of Manchester, 2011, part of Moving
        Planet: a day to move past fossil
        fuels [K]. The exhibitors have collectively given a huge number (we
      estimate, hundreds) of public
      engagement talks to e.g. Sci-Bars, Caf&amp;#233;-Scientifiques, Guilds,
      professional bodies such as IOP
      and IChemE, and schools. Feedback from follow-on events suggests that this
      engagement is as
      effective as the original exhibitions [e.g. F]; this allows us to estimate
      (conservatively) that this
      legacy activity has positively influenced more than 60,000 students
      towards choosing a science-based
      career.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    We demonstrate a sustained record of the highest quality public
      engagement with physics,
      evidenced by the selection of our research for the Royal Society Summer
      Science Exhibition on
      eight occasions in six successive years (2008 - 2013). Collectively, these
      exhibits have received
      more than 94,000 visitors, increasing the knowledge of physics and
      interest in physics of school
      pupils and the general public. Each exhibit has produced a lasting legacy
      of on-going public
      engagement, influencing, for example, the career choices of an estimated
      60,000 students.

    The research described below underpinned eight separate exhibits at the
      Royal Society; where no
      date is given, named academic staff members were in post at UoM/UMIST 1993
      &amp;#8212; present.
    
      A technique for finding planets orbitting other stars, based on
        gravitational microlensing, was
        originally proposed by Mao (while at Princeton University; UoM staff
        99-) and was developed at
        Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA), leading to the first
        detections of planets by this
        technique in 2004-06 (e.g. [1], work led by Mao and involving Rattenbury
        (RA 04-09)).
      JBCA played a central role in the 2009 Planck space mission, which has
        made the most
        precise map of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, by building
        the Planck LFI's 30
        and 44 GHz low noise amplifiers [2], which are still the lowest noise
        receivers ever built at
        these frequencies. The work was led by Davis (staff, awarded an OBE for
        this in 2011) whilst
        Maffei (staff 06-) and Pisano (staff 06-) played key roles in the HFI
        optics. Early findings
        included the most precise spectrum of spinning dust emission from the
        interstellar medium led
        by C Dickinson (RA 07-09, STFC AF09-).
      Liquid crystal research from 1995 by Gleeson (staff), Dierking (staff
        02-), M Dickinson (staff)
        and Novoselov, has included understanding novel materials for
        next-generation fast-switching
        displays, for example, the first measurement of biaxial order in a
        nematic liquid crystal [3] and
        the first physically reasonable model for the origin of polarized vision
        in vertebrates.
      The 2004 discovery of graphene by Geim (staff 01-) and Novoselov
        (staff 06-; RA 01-06) [4]
        led to the award of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. Many of the unique
        properties of graphene
        and its derivatives were discovered and explored in the School. Key
        among these are the
        feasibility of working with atomically-thin films [4], the relativistic
        behaviour of charge carriers, a
        new kind of Quantum Hall Effect, and the observation of fast spin
        currents in graphene.
      Research from 2007 on the photonic and surface properties of quantum
        dots as light-
        harvesting elements in next-generation solar cells, and their wider use
        in the generation of
        solar fuel, includes the first observation of 'carrier multiplication'
        (creation of more than one
        carrier pair per incoming photon) in InP quantum dots [5]. Exploitation
        offers a significant
        increase in cell efficiency. Key researchers are: Flavell (staff), Binks
        (staff 01-), Graham (RA
        04-11; EPSRC CAF 11-), Hardman (RA 07-10), Spencer (PG 06-11; RA 11-),
        and Stubbs (PG
        06-10; RA 10).
      JBCA played an important role in the design and first science of the
        Atacama Large
        Millimeter/Sub-Millimeter Array (ALMA). It led the optical design and
        prototyping of the fibre-
        optic link technology connecting the ALMA antennas and, since 2009, has
        hosted the UK
        Regional Centre, providing support and expertise for astronomers using
        the ALMA telescope.
        The first phase of observations started in 2012, with one of the first
        papers published showed
        the gravitational collapse of gas around a forming protostar [6]. Key
        staff: Fuller (staff 1996-)
        and Avison (PG 07-10, RA 10-).
      UoM physicists played key roles on the ATLAS experiment at CERN and
        the D0 experiment at
        the Tevatron, which led to the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. On
        ATLAS, staff
        contributed to the construction and operation of the detector (notably
        Loebinger (staff),
        Ibbotson (staff -05) and Duerdoth (staff -05)), and to triggering,
        operation and data analysis
        (Wengler (staff 05-10), Oh (RS URF 09-), Yang (staff 06-13)) [7].
        Several analyses contributing
        to the Higgs evidence observed at the Tevatron were performed by PhD
        students, RAs, and
        staff, notably Soldner-Rembold (staff 03-, D0 coordinator 09-11),
        Schwanenberger (staff 07-,
        D0 coordinator 11-12), Peters (RA 05-10) and Petridis (RA 10-12).

    Research on the function of the promotional and ephemeral (short-form)
      texts that surround film and television content has helped generate
        new ways of thinking that influence creative practice. The ephemeral
      media workshop (July 2009) held at Nottingham was especially influential
      in giving the BBC a new vocabulary for how it can use and repurpose
      ephemeral items from its archives and give them value as assets. Victoria
      Jaye (BBC Vision) confirms that the term ephemeral media `has really got
      some traction in this organization thanks to the AHRC workshop at the
      University of Nottingham' (Source C p.114). Jaye explains how the
      BBC has looked anew at the value of audition tapes and artefacts from its
      archive, and how these can be used within the online programme pages of
      the BBC. As such, the ephemeral media workshop provided a stimulus to a
      senior BBC executive for thinking about how broadcast ephemera might be
      utilized to offer promotional and public service value for the BBC.
      According to Jaye, the `BBC has benefited from the thinking and the
      language I have brought back to the organisation in terms of how we
      conceive the opportunity and describe our public service role in the
      digital media landscape' (Source D).
    For Charlie Mawer, the Executive Creative Director of Red Bee Media with
      responsibility for all creative work in the Creative Division, the
      workshop provided `new references and case studies that [he] could use to
      stimulate new thinking' about promotional design (Source D).
      Moreover, the event led to strategic networking opportunities between
      Mawer and Jaye, deepening agency/client relations between Red Bee and the
      BBC that have underpinned subsequent projects such as the TV promotion of
      the BBC iPlayer (2012). The workshop enabled Jaye and Mawer to `gain
      kudos' and develop `thought leadership' in their sectors, something which
      has practical currency and economic value in selling market expertise (Red
      Bee's Creative department brought in revenues of &amp;#163;35 million in 2012) (Source
        D). Jaye was invited to MIT and has written `presentations and
      strategic documents that draw on the insights and discussions we had as
      part of the ephemeral media workshop' (Source D) and Mawer has been
      cited by journalists based on videocasts and a prime-time television
      feature on BBC East Midlands Today (22 November 2009) that stemmed
      from his plenary. The workshop generated new ways of thinking about the
      role of promotional short-forms for industry beneficiaries, and these new
      ways of thinking have been furthered in presentations by Johnson on
      branding and the television industry to Ofcom in 2010. This knowledge has
      been shared at an institutional level at Red Bee and the BBC helping to develop
        relationships that have enabled media companies and professionals to
        refine and sell their expertise.
    In industrial terms, sustained collaboration with Red Bee Media, central
      to the AHRC Follow-on award, has informed strategic business planning
        and helped professionals and organizations adapt to changing cultural
        values, specifically, as mentioned, the challenges of `build[ing]
      bridges between content and viewers' in a multiplatform environment.
      Through engagement with strategic Red Bee projects/personnel, including 32
      practitioner interviews, the research facilitated self-reflection about
      disciplinary practice in the promotional screen industries. Knowledge
      exchange resulted in two internal reports to Red Bee's Creative division,
      the chief beneficiary being Red Bee's senior management team. According to
      Red Bee's Director of Creative, responsible for the overall management of
      the Creative Division, the reports have `helped us to think more deeply
      about the theories and disciplines of our work in TV promotion and design
      .. . and have been influential in informing our strategic business
      planning' (Source A). He continues: `a further benefit of this work
      has been to widen our company's awareness of academic work currently
      happening in the UK with a focus on our industry . . . enriching our
      understanding of our craft and influencing our thinking on new areas of
      research to guide and inform our future business models' (Source A).
      In this last respect, the research has catalyzed industrial-academic
      collaboration in the emerging area of social television, with a `hothouse'
      on the subject hosted by the University of Nottingham in September 2012
      bringing together industry practitioners with academics from the major
      research hubs Horizon (see above) and Research and Enterprise in Arts and
      Creative Technology (REACT), funded respectively through RCUK's Digital
      Economy and Creative Economy themes (for more on collaborations with both
      Horizon and REACT, see REF5). This event brokered the partnership
      of Red Bee, Thinkbox (the trade body for television marketing), British
      Telecom and Ofcom in audience research on the multi-screen household,
      funded by Horizon. As a direct result of the hothouse, one Red Bee planner
      `reached out to the Heads of Research at UKTV, Channel 4 and the BBC to
      discuss the possibilities of collaborating with all of them and Horizon to
      help shape academic research questions that might inform future business
      strategy and audience understanding' (Source B). The research has
      therefore helped stimulate and shape a key collaborative project around
      social TV that will continue to inform business strategy in this area.
    Finally, the research has had public impact raising the visibility of
        the creative and professional discipline of promotional screen design.
      Specifically, Grainge/Johnson's engagement with key practitioners led to
      the presentation of promotional work and heritage at the BFI Southbank in
      two panel events funded by the AHRC Follow-on Fund (28 November 2012).
      These panels focused on `The Contemporary Art of TV Promotion and Design'
      and `Pioneers of TV Promotion and Design' and featured the Executive
      Creative Directors of Red Bee and Crystal CG, major industry figures
      including Martin Lambie-Nairn and David Liddiment, and continuity
      announcers and trailer-makers from the 1960s including David Hamilton and
      Maurice Kanareck. Curated by Grainge/Johnson in collaboration with the
      BFI, these panels offered public audiences the opportunity to learn about
      the creative process of TV and digital promotion, now and in the past, and
      were both sell-out events attended by 250 people (125x2). Of the 66
      feedback cards collected, 99 per cent of respondents said `the event
      increased their understanding of the art of TV promotion and design' and
      that they had `learnt something new about the way TV promotion and design
      is created' (Source E). Members of the public commented on the
      events being `wonderful' and `highly informative' with the `archive promos
      being extraordinary.' Some said it was `great to have an unexplored art
      form given prominence,' and others encouraged `more BFI joint sessions
      like this' (Source E). This impact has been broadened through
      YouTube videos made by Grainge/Johnson on `Interstitials' and `Idents'
      which have received 3,500 views (2009 &amp;#8212; present) and a range of user
      comments (e.g. `that was surprisingly interesting. I haven't even thought
      about those things that much before' (Source G)), further enhancing
      the visibility of the promotional screen industries.
    Curating these events had a wider impact on the BFI, enabling personnel
      within its television archive to digitally restore examples of
      historically valuable promotional texts for future public screenings, and
      helping the BFI to develop educational content planning. According
      to the TV Programmer at BFI Southbank, `working with the University of
      Nottingham enabled us to identify an area we haven't addressed before and
      to stage an event that attracted a new constituency of students studying
      Media and Design at Art College' (Source H). Specifically, the
      panel events were preceded by a BFI masterclass for 15-25 year olds on
      ident and logo design, led by two creative directors from Red Bee. The
      masterclass was part of a broader competition in which young adults across
      the UK were invited to submit ideas for a logo/ident for the BFI's `Future
      Film' educational programme. The masterclass was attended by fifty
      students from leading design colleges including Ravensbourne and Edinburgh
      Napier, and provided insight into the creative practice of promotional
      design. In the feedback questionnaires, 100 per cent of respondents said
      they `agreed' or `strongly agreed' that the `masterclass taught them about
      the creative process of making idents and logos' and were `more likely to
      consider a job creating logos and idents' as a result (Source F).
      More broadly, promotion was included as a dedicated panel session (led by
      Grainge) at the BFI Media Conference (4-5 July 2013), an event
      focusing on the professional development of teachers of screen media.
      Through curation of the public events, the development of the masterclass
      as an educational event, and the contribution made to the conference,
      Grainge and Johnson worked with two divisions of the British Film Insitute
      &amp;#8212; BFI Southbank and BFI Education &amp;#8212; illustrating just some of the ways in
      which the Department of Culture, Film and Media is benefitting from

    Grainge and Johnson have an established history of undertaking research
      that examines the ways in which the film and television industries are
      adopting the discourses and practices of branding and promotion. For
      Johnson this has involved sustained consideration of the emergence of
      branding as a key strategy for Western television industries and the
      shifting marketing strategies used by television broadcasters in the UK
      and the U.S. since the 1980s (see References B and E). This
      has included an on-going relationship with Victoria Jaye (Head of IPTV and
      TV online content for BBC Vision) first initiated in the AHRC/BBC
      Knowledge Exchange workshops in 2006. Grainge's work on branding and the
      U.S. film industry dates from 2002 and has provided key insights through
      publications and research grants into the industrial and textual economy
      of branding in Hollywood (Reference A). More broadly, it has opened
      out debates on the function and status of `ephemeral media,' describing
      promotional short-forms such as logos, promos, idents, and trailers (Reference
        C, D and F). This research has been advanced in three grants
      with a deliberate focus on industry-academic knowledge exchange. This
      includes the Ephemeral Media workshop (2008-9), funded as part of
      the AHRC's Beyond Text programme, which involved the BBC (Victoria
      Jaye), the BFI and Red Bee Media as participants, the AHRC Follow-On Fund
      award TV and Digital Promotion: Agile Strategies for a New Media
        Ecology (2012-13) that deepened relations with Red Bee and the BFI,
      and the EPSRC Cross-Disciplinary Feasibility account award Towards
        Pervasive Media (2009-11) which laid the ground for
      industry-academic research collaboration with the Horizon Digital Economy
      Research hub based at the university (see REF5).
    Key findings and insights stemming from the research of Grainge and
      Johnson can be summarized as:
    
      the U.S. and UK film/television industries adopted branding as a
        systematic practice from the 1980s in response to increased competition
        for viewers and revenue
      the branding of television corporations, programmes, channels and
        services has become a key strategy that aims to increase revenue
        streams, capture audience attention, increase viewer loyalty and
        communicate the values of television to viewers
      identifying how branding strategies are enacted across multiple media
        platforms as the film and television industries attempt to utilise the
        potential of new platforms (the internet, mobiles etc) for marketing and
        distribution.
    
    Critically, the underpinning research has engaged with a problem
      identified by industry and summarized by Red Bee Media as how to `build
      bridges between content and viewers' in the digital media ecology (www.redbeemedia.com/about-us/overview).
      The research findings demonstrate the significance of promotional media in
      contemporary screen culture, and the terms upon which such media is
      required to be agile in a multiplatform and highly competitive media
      landscape. This has been developed through two major book projects on
      branding in the film and television industries (References A and B),
      a workshop and edited collection on ephemeral media (Reference C),
      and industry fieldwork with Red Bee Media, a world-leading digital and
      communications company which employs 1,500 staff and has an annual
      turnover of &amp;#163;130million. Furthermore, the findings redress the sometimes
      dismissive attitude towards marketing and promotion within academic and
      industry discourse by highlighting the nature of promotion as a creative
      and professional discipline. The research has produced new knowledge about
      media promotion for industry practitioners, raised public awareness of the
      creative work involved, and has facilitated knowledge exchange between
      academics and industry practitioners in strategic areas of TV and digital
      promotion such as `social television.'

    The beneficiaries of the underpinning research have been:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Merck's Liquid Crystals business unit, which increased turnover by&#xD;
        8.0% to &amp;#8364;1,094 million in 2011 from &amp;#8364;1,013 million in 2010. "This&#xD;
        [growth] stemmed from the ongoing demand, particularly for IPS (in-plane&#xD;
        switching) technologies for smart-phone touch-screens and PS-VA&#xD;
        (polymer-stabilized vertical alignment) as well as VA (vertical&#xD;
        alignment) technologies for TV displays."[A,B]
&#xD;
      Manufacturers of LCDs, who produced LCDs worth $99.4 billion in 2011&#xD;
        rising to a turnover of $107.7 billion in 2012 including 216 million&#xD;
        LCD-TVs.[C-G]
&#xD;
      Micron Technology, USA, and Forth Dimension Displays, UK, which are&#xD;
        the two main manufacturers of F-LCOS microdisplays in a market worth&#xD;
        $250 million in 2011.[H,I]
&#xD;
      Kingston Chemicals Limited, which had a turnover of &amp;#163;200k in 2011.&#xD;
      The users of devices with VAN-LCDs, such as banks, who benefit from&#xD;
        the significantly lower energy consumption of LCDs (10%-25%) compared to&#xD;
        that required for CRTs.[J]
&#xD;
      Purchasers of consumer devices, such as LCD TVs, laptops, with better&#xD;
        LCD screens.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    The two LCD applications that have benefited most from liquid crystals&#xD;
      based on the ortho-difluorophenyl unit developed and optimised at&#xD;
      the University of Hull during the assessment period, in collaboration with&#xD;
      the MoD and E. Merck, are VAN-LCDs for LCD-TVs, which is a multi-billion&#xD;
      pound market involving very large LCDs in TVs and laptop computers, and&#xD;
      F-LCOS LCDs, primarily used in camera viewfinders, which is a niche, but&#xD;
      very important market, using small LCDs. Vertically Aligned Nematic&#xD;
      technology encompasses several variants, such as Polymer-stabilised-,&#xD;
      Multidomain- and Patterned-VA-LCDs.[D-F]&#xD;
    VAN-LCDs have replaced bulky cathode ray tube displays as well as earlier&#xD;
      LCDs and provide the majority of the 216 million LCD-TVs sold in 2012,&#xD;
      from manufacturers such as Samsung, Sharp and Sony.[C] The&#xD;
      advantageous VAN-LCD technology is increasingly (2008 to present time)&#xD;
      being employed in smaller displays for desktop and laptop displays, which&#xD;
      is a very high volume market. Additionally, because of the lower power&#xD;
      consumption and cheaper production costs, VAN-LCD technology is now being&#xD;
      introduced into the mobile phone and tablet markets. No other current&#xD;
      design of material can match those based on the ortho-difluorophenyl
      unit for the combination of liquid crystallinity, low viscosity and high&#xD;
      negative dielectric anisotropy required for VAN displays. [D-G]&#xD;
    "Liquid Crystals generate more than 70% of the [E. Merck performance&#xD;
        materials] division's sales [&amp;#8364;1,719 million]. Based on a market share of&#xD;
        between 50% and 60%, this business has for many years commanded the&#xD;
        number one market position for liquid crystal mixtures used in liquid&#xD;
        crystal displays (LCDs). With the broadest offering in the industry, the&#xD;
        business unit's product portfolio comprises liquid crystals tailored to&#xD;
        match the individual requirements of the full range of LCDs, from small&#xD;
        displays in smart phones to ultra-large televisions. The portfolio&#xD;
        includes liquid crystals based on polymer stabilized vertical alignment&#xD;
        (PS-VA) technologies, primarily used in mid- and large-sized&#xD;
        televisions, as well as liquid crystals based on in-plane switching&#xD;
        (IPS) technology, which are also used in televisions as well as&#xD;
        increasingly in mobile devices such as tablet PCs and smart phones. The&#xD;
        Liquid Crystals business unit operates in a highly consolidated market&#xD;
        with a total of only three suppliers, indicating the high barriers to&#xD;
        entry as a result of the scientific complexity of liquid crystals and&#xD;
        their high quality requirements. Liquid Crystals supplies all seven&#xD;
        major LCD panel manufacturers that serve television manufacturers or&#xD;
        other consumer electronics companies."[B]&#xD;
    The ortho-difluorophenyl unit is also present in smectic&#xD;
      liquid crystals, developed and optimised at the University of Hull in the&#xD;
      assessment period, that are essential components of smectic&#xD;
      mixtures used in Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal on Silicon (F-LCOS)&#xD;
      microdisplays, which are small LCDs with a cell thickness of less than a&#xD;
      micron. The amount of liquid crystal material used is very small when&#xD;
      compared with that used in VAN-LCDs, but nevertheless the commercial&#xD;
      impact is still very significant. F-LCOS microdisplays provide very high&#xD;
      resolution and extremely fast switching, and are employed in head-mounted&#xD;
      displays for training simulators and computer games, and in camera&#xD;
      viewfinders for the film, military and medical industries. The high&#xD;
      value-added nature of the liquid crystals used in F-LCOS microdisplays&#xD;
      provides an ideal business for Kingston Chemicals Limited, which&#xD;
      manufactures ortho-difluorophenyl liquid crystals and formulates&#xD;
      ferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures containing them for Display Tech and&#xD;
      Forth Dimension Displays. Citizen Finetech Mijota Japan, which now owns&#xD;
      Display Tech,[H] and Forth Dimension Displays, are two of the&#xD;
      main manufacturers of F-LCOS microdisplays in a global microdisplays&#xD;
      market expected to reach $995 million by 2016 from $250 million in 2011.[I]&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    216 million LCD-TVs were sold in 2012 many of which incorporate liquid&#xD;
      crystals invented in Hull. Research on the design, synthesis and&#xD;
      evaluation of liquid crystals of negative dielectric anisotropy and the&#xD;
      formulation of liquid crystalline mixtures incorporating them enabled the&#xD;
      successful commercialisation of two types of Liquid Crystal&#xD;
      Displays (LCDs), i.e., Vertically Aligned Nematic (VAN)-LCDs for&#xD;
      televisions, desktop monitors and laptop computers and Ferroelectric&#xD;
      Liquid Crystals on Silicon (F-LCOS) microdisplays used in head-mounted&#xD;
      displays for training simulators, computer games and in camera&#xD;

      Prototypes were fabricated, but not manufactured on a large scale due to&#xD;
      fabrication and shock-stability problems. This joint research carried out&#xD;
      between the University of Hull, E. Merck, and funded by the Defence&#xD;
      Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) led to joint patents owned by DERA,&#xD;
      covering this generic class of compounds.1,2&#xD;
    Post-1993 research between the University of Hull, Merck and DERA&#xD;
      focussed on designing modified terphenyl-type structures, such as 1-6,&#xD;
      with exclusively nematic mesophases for VAN-LCDs in order&#xD;
      to facilitate the large scale manufacture of LCD-TVs. The design of nematic&#xD;
      liquid crystals with a large lateral dipole &amp;#8212; and hence a significant&#xD;
      negative dielectric anisotropy &amp;#8212; was a major, unresolved challenge at that&#xD;
      time.3,4&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    Post-1993 research at the University of Hull focussed on completely&#xD;
      suppressing the smectic (layered) nature of the&#xD;
      ortho-difluoroterphenyls and replacing it with the desired (non-layered) nematic&#xD;
      phase required for VAN-LCDs for LCD TVs. The presence of a smectic phase&#xD;
      even at very low temperatures, e.g., at &amp;#8212;50 oC, below a&#xD;
      nematic phase can result in a high viscosity of the nematic phase above it&#xD;
      at room temperature. The smectic and nematic phases of terphenyl&#xD;
      derivatives synthesised up to that point were highly viscous and exhibited&#xD;
      very high melting points and poor solubility in liquid crystal mixtures.&#xD;
      The post-1993 research at the University of Hull led to the synthesis of&#xD;
      ortho-difluoroterphenyls with a broad nematic phase, low melting points, a&#xD;
      high nematic clearing point and most importantly, generated a high&#xD;
      negative dielectric anisotropy (-2.5 &amp;gt; &amp;#916;&amp;#949; &amp;gt; -7) and a high&#xD;
      birefringence (&amp;#916;n &amp;gt; 0.20). Nematic mixtures containing them,&#xD;
      developed with colleagues at DERA and Merck, exhibit low viscosity&#xD;
      (&amp;#947; 1 ~ 100), a wide operating temperature range&#xD;
      (typically -50 oC to 120 oC), appropriate elastic&#xD;
      constant ratios (k11, k22,&#xD;
      and k33), moderate birefringence (&amp;#916;n ~ 0.08)&#xD;
      and dielectric anisotropy (-3 &amp;gt; &amp;#916;&amp;#949; &amp;gt; -4) values, a short&#xD;
      optical path (d&amp;#916;n &amp;lt; 0.3), high pre-tilt angles (1o - 5o),&#xD;
      high voltage holding ratios (VHR), fast response times (ca. 20 ms),&#xD;
      wide viewing angles with high optical contrast at low operating voltages&#xD;
      (2-3 V) in very large, full-colour, video-rate VAN-LCDs for LCD TVs.2-6&#xD;
      Many of these objectives are mutually exclusive and many non-linear&#xD;
      effects and non-ideal behaviour are observed, especially in complex&#xD;
      mixtures with between 10 - 20, sometimes 50, individual components.&#xD;
      Another key aspect of the successful commercialisation of VAN-LCDs for the&#xD;
      TV market was the development at the University of Hull of optimised&#xD;
      reaction conditions for the Suzuki aryl-aryl cross-coupling reaction to&#xD;
      synthesise difluoro-substituted liquid crystals on a cost-effective&#xD;
      industrial scale.4&#xD;
    A substantial body of related research between 2000-2004, funded by the&#xD;
      Ministry of Defence (UK) and the EPSRC, and 2004-2007, funded by the DTI&#xD;
      and Kingston Chemicals, led to structures such as 7 and 8,&#xD;
      which were designed to generate a bookshelf molecular alignment to further&#xD;
      optimize liquid crystal mixtures for F-LCOS applications.7-8&#xD;

    Swansea's research in cold dwell sensitivity and advanced lifing has
      delivered significant commercial and economic impact, with improved
      understanding of mechanical behaviour, deformation and failure mechanisms
      that has defined safe operational envelopes for various titanium and
      nickel alloys utilised in fan, compressor and turbine applications in the
      current generation of Rolls-Royce Trent engines. More than five hundred
      Trent 800 engines are currently in service [C1].
    Rolls-Royce supplies approximately 40% of new aero-engines to the global
      market, acting as one of three major international manufacturers of civil
      aero-engines with an order book exceeding &amp;#163;60,000m; Swansea's contribution
      to the mechanical characterisation of metallic alloys and ceramics
      therefore provides significant and tangible impact. Knowledge generated
      through long standing collaboration between industry and academia has been
      transferred to Rolls-Royce and key supply chain companies (Timet in
      particular, the largest producer of titanium in Europe). Research has made
      critical technological contributions to the manufacture of efficient and
      safe gas turbines, with impact evident in the following ways:
    Titanium alloy selection and fan disc design in Rolls-Royce Trent
        engines, informed by models describing crystal plasticity and stress
      redistribution. The Evans-Bache model describing cold dwell behaviour in
      titanium alloys has underpinned the exchange of coarse grained alloys
      (e.g. Ti685, Ti829) as compressor disc materials for alternative alloys
      (Ti6/4, Ti834, Ti6246) with superior cold dwell resistance.
    "Component design, full scale rig evaluation and service stressing
        have been greatly influenced by this research. The impact dates back to
        the RB211 fleet through to the latest generation Trent XWB series.
        Swansea investigations into Ti834 for example, used in high pressure
        compressor discs in the Trent 800 engine with &amp;gt;500 currently in
        service powering 225 aircraft, remain key to our future implementation
        of titanium alloys" Company Fellow &amp;#8212; Titanium Alloys / Fan Systems,
      Rolls-Royce [C1].
    Provision of confidential, non-advocate reviews. Rolls-Royce's
      high profile `Red-Top' investigations are used to assess issues relating
      to the processing and safe operation of engine components. Within the REF
      period, Evans and Bache have provided scrutiny for topics including fan
      blade manufacture, stress concentration features in compressor discs and
      interpretation of fatigue crack initiation and growth in titanium metal
      matrix composite under spin rig assessment.
    Innovative fractography has been employed to investigate manufacturing
      and service issues and understand fundamental material response.
    "Knowledge transferred from the Swansea UTC academics into our
        industry is a key independent resource, which can actually prevent major
        fleet disruptions" Head of Materials, Rolls-Royce [C2].
    Swansea provides major contributions towards more efficient,
      environmentally friendly engines by characterising mechanical behaviour at
      ever increasing temperatures. The combined portfolio of research has
      delivered a reduction of 1% in specific fuel consumption,
      representing significant environmental and economic impact. By elevating
      the operating temperature through all stages of the engine, the volumes of
      sulphur / nitrogen based emissions have been progressively reduced,
      meeting objectives set by International government agencies. This places
      significant demands on existing alloys, expected to operate beyond their
      original design limits. Specifically, mechanical data and lifing
        correlations were incorporated into proprietary computer models at
        Rolls-Royce in 2008, allowing the alloy Ti6246 to continue under
      safe operation some 50oC above pre-envisaged limits. This
      required detailed understanding of high temperature damage mechanisms.
      This alloy is used across the Trent range (&amp;gt;3000 engines in service).
      Similarly, advanced lifing correlations were applied to the Ti6-4 lift-fan
      in the F136 Joint Strike Fighter, allowing development on this engine
      through to 2011.
    "Swansea based correlations have been transferred to several engine
        marks and alloys, allowing extended operation of in service alloys
        through reducing conservative safety margins" Associate Fellow,
      Critical Parts Lifing and Integrity, Rolls-Royce [C3].
    Similar research has been directed towards nickel superalloys, with the
      same proprietary codes used to design future engine variants (Trent 1000,
      XWB etc). Detailed understanding of the role of microstructure on fatigue
      has allowed rationalisation amongst modelling procedures, with multiple
      codes previously deemed necessary to describe different forms of the same
      alloy.
    The Swansea UTC is a core member to the EPSRC Rolls-Royce Strategic
      Partnership in Structural Metallic Systems for Gas Turbines (2009),
      incorporating postdoctoral research and doctoral training to develop high
      calibre materials engineers for the UK metals community over a ten year
      horizon. Value to the UK public sector and overall success of this scheme
      is constantly reviewed by EPSRC, with Swansea knowledge transfer
      activities singled out for a RCUK online impact case study "Excellence
      With Impact" [C4]. The rolling value of the research in progress under the
      combined UTC research portfolio currently stands &amp;gt;&amp;#163;7.8m.
    Economic impact has also been achieved through the creation of a
        profitable spin-out company. Swansea University has combined
      extensive consultancy activities with a major transfer of equipment from
      the former Rolls-Royce laboratories at Derby (replacement value &amp;gt;&amp;#163;5m).
      A spin- out company &amp;#8212; Swansea Materials Research &amp;amp; Testing Ltd (SMaRT)
      has been incorporated [C5]. Rolls-Royce places significant onus on this
      operation, "SMaRT acts as a vital, strategic, approved supplier for
        mechanical property understanding at technology readiness levels (TRL)
        zero to four" (C2). This outsourcing strategy includes close
      collaboration with the Rolls-Royce Mechanical Test and Operations Centre
      in Germany (MTOC). SMaRT delivers commercial testing and academic
      interpretation for an expanding customer base, and is integral to the
      development of the University's new, &amp;#163;250m Science and Innovation Campus,
      which in turn addresses Welsh Government strategies for regional
      development in South-West Wales. SMaRT has recently achieved ISO 17025
      accreditation, employs nine full-time staff, turning over approximately
      &amp;#163;1M per annum, with operating profits of &amp;#163;146k posted in 2011-12 [C5].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research in materials characterisation at Swansea University has produced
      a deeper understanding of the mechanical behaviour of proprietary engine
      components, and the potential improvements that can be made. The research
      has provided a critical technological contribution to the manufacture of
      efficient and robust gas turbine engines, fundamentally supporting the
      declaration of safe working lives for critical rotating components,
      contributing to a significant reduction in specific fuel consumption, and
      enabling Rolls-Royce to maintain a 40% share of the global civil aviation
      market. The research has led to the creation of a profitable spin-out
      company (Swansea Materials Research &amp;amp; Testing Ltd - SMaRT) with an
      initial annual turnover of &amp;#163;1m.

    The research underpinning this impact case is based on two core topics: a
      fundamental understanding of "cold dwell sensitivity" in near-alpha
      titanium alloys, and advanced lifing (component life estimation)
      correlations supporting component design and safe operation.
    i) Cold dwell behaviour was first acknowledged from the
      in-service failure of RB211 fan discs in the 1970s. Through expertise
      transferred to Swansea University from the National Gas Turbine
      Establishment Farnborough (WJ Evans), plus core research undertaken at
      Swansea (MR Bache), the combination of anisotropic crystal plasticity and
      stress redistribution was attributed as the pre- requisite for
      "quasi-cleavage facet formation" and dwell induced failures. A series of
      seminal academic papers, keynote presentations at international
      conferences [R1] and high citations [R2] resulted, describing
      the "Evans-Bache" model.
    The application of electron back scattered diffraction for measuring
      facet inclination on fracture surfaces was pioneered at Swansea [R3] and
      more recent numerical codes have allowed automated quantitative tilt
      fractography. Testing in collaboration with Rolls-Royce has provided new
      insights into the behaviour of titanium crystalline structures, with the
      result that new titanium alloys have been developed. Every alloy used by
      Rolls-Royce now goes through the dwell and fatigue assessment developed at
      Swansea.
    ii) Unrivalled testing facilities for the characterisation of
      constitutive behaviour have underpinned the development of advanced
        lifing algorithms applied to Class "A" safety critical titanium
      components. Research conducted under EPSRC grant (GR/R80926/01) along with
      Rolls-Royce private venture funding (&amp;#163;420K, 2006) married fundamental
      materials knowledge to non-linear, strain based lifing procedures applied
      to Ti6/4 fan disc material, which was subsequently selected for the F136
      engine variant of the Joint Strike Fighter. Similar studies were completed
      on Ti6246 compressor disc alloy. Such techniques encompassed intimate
      knowledge of creep-fatigue- environmental interactions gathered from
      precise, empirical experimentation in the Swansea laboratories.
    Fatigue crack initiation and crack propagation were predicted based only
      on deformation characteristics in the alloy [R4]. Specific expertise in
      creep has been extended, superseding the former "Theta" creep models
      developed pre-2000, with the "Wilshire Equations". MT Whittaker and KM
      Perkins have applied the latter to a range of conventional and
      intermetallic alloys with great success, acknowledged by keynote
      presentations and publication in high impact factor journals [R5, R6].
    Context: Swansea University's expertise in gas turbine materials
      has attracted international recognition through research publications and
      seminal texts in the fields of high temperature creep (B Wilshire and RW
      Evans) plus fatigue and fracture (WJ Evans and MR Bache). This led to the
      award of the EPSRC Interdisciplinary Research Centre in High Performance
      Materials (1989) and the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre (UTC) in
      Titanium (1995). The establishment of the Swansea UTC enabled long term,
      strategic activities in the areas of material processing, microstructure
      evolution, mechanical behaviour and component life estimation, providing a
      holistic approach to understanding their inter-relationships. More
      recently this research culminated in the inclusion of the Swansea UTC in
      the EPSRC Rolls-Royce Strategic Partnership in Structural Metallic Systems
      for Gas Turbine Applications (EP/H500383/1 and EP/H022309/1 with a total
      value for research and training of &amp;#163;50m, 2009-2019).
    Research in cold dwell behaviour led to the award of the IoM3 Harvey
      Flower Titanium Prize for "contribution to an improved understanding of
      titanium metallurgy or alloy development" to WJ Evans in 2007 and MR Bache
      in 2012.

    X-ray crystallography has grown to be one of the pillars of research and
      development in the
      pharmaceutical industry, where the atomic interactions with drug targets
      of many candidate
      molecules are studied to optimise them in the development of new drugs.
      Industrial
      crystallographers examine numerous complexes with the same target or many
      examples from
      "druggable" families of proteins such as kinases, so molecular replacement
      is one of their most
      important tools.
    Phaser met a real need for both academic and industrial
      crystallographers, indicated by its rapid
      adoption in preference to previous programs for carrying out molecular
      replacement calculations.
      After it was released in 2003, it quickly caught on because of success in
      solving a number of
      structures that had resisted years of effort. The 1000th
      download was marked within 15 months of
      the initial release. Already by 2008, 1190 of 6248 X-ray crystal
      structures (19%) released in the
      Protein Data Bank (PDB: www.rcsb.org) cited the use of Phaser (ref. 1).
      From 2008, this has
      continued to grow: 1648 of 6746 (24%) structures released in 2009, 2122 of
      7296 (29%) in 2010,
      2705 of 7468 (36%) in 2011, 3067 of 8302 (37%) in 2012 and 2367 of 5962
      (40%) up to the end of
      August in 2013. Given that X-ray crystal structures account for about 90%
      of new entries in the
      PDB, Phaser has accounted for over 1/3 of all new macromolecular
      structures in the last three
      years.
    Though most structures in the PDB are contributed by academic
      researchers, it should be noted
      that the pharmaceutical industry makes heavy use of these data, including
      the many structures
      solved with the use of Phaser. Industrial scientists have also rapidly
      adopted Phaser, for the same
      reasons as their academic colleagues.
    Specific examples of impact in the pharmaceutical industry are documented
      in two letters. A
      research fellow at Bristol-Myers Squibb(ref. 2) describes several cases in
      which the use of Phaser
      allowed the solution of structures that had previously been difficult or
      even impossible. In one
      specific example he describes working on the structure of a
      biologic/target complex, where he had
      only a limited amount of protein and a limited number of crystals and for
      which he states that
      Phaser was "crucial to the determination of this structure". An Associate
      Principal Scientist at
      AstraZeneca (ref. 3) states that "Phaser has been instrumental in solving
      several target structures
      recently, and helped the progress of these projects by making a costly and
      lengthy experimental
      phasing unnecessary, which would otherwise be a bottleneck in a structure
      based drug discovery
      campaign". AstraZeneca employs about 30 FTEs in structural biology, and
      they "consider Phaser
      as a tool of choice when solving novel structures by molecular
      replacement". She also states that
      "Phaser outperforms other programs and gives better confidence in the
      solution". Both of these
      researchers in industry emphasise that, by making difficult problems easy,
      valuable time is saved.
    We have clear evidence of wider take-up by industrial users. Licences to
      use Phaser are
      available as part of two packages: CCP4 (about 120 site licences of the
      package, at $9500 per
      licence, to industry including AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
      GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-La
      Roche, Merck, Novartis and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, ref. 4) and Phenix (13
      industrial participants
      in its consortium, ref. 5). A search of US patents (ref. 6) reveals that
      42 patents filed since the
      beginning of 2008 cite the use of Phaser in the research underlying the
      new intellectual property.
      Considering that there is an average of nearly three years between these
      patent applications being
      filed and granted, this is very much a lower bounds estimate of the impact
      of Phaser on the
      development of new IP. These patents have been assigned to a variety of
      entities, including
      Genentech, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Novo Nordisk and, in the UK, MedImmune
      and Heptares
      Therapeutics.
    The Phaser development team has answered queries about the use of Phaser
      from scientists at
      22 different companies, including Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers
      Squibb, Johnson&amp;amp;Johnson,
      Heptares Therapeutics, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis. In addition,
      industrial crystallographers
      attend the annual CCP4 Study Weekend and the biannual Phenix Developers'
      Workshop, where
      they take the opportunity to ask questions about the use of Phaser and to
      request new features.
    Industrial royalty revenues received by the Phenix team are shared among
      the partners. The
      Cambridge share of about &amp;#163;180,000 to March 2013 has been distributed among
      the University,
      CIMR, Catalyst (Wellcome Trust) and the Phaser developers.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules is a
      prerequisite for
      understanding their function at the atomic level, an essential component
      of modern drug
      development. Most structures are determined by X-ray crystallography: the
      majority using
      molecular replacement (MR, which exploits known structures of related
      proteins), and about half of
      the remainder using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD). The
      Phaser crystallographic
      software, developed by Read and colleagues, implements powerful new
      likelihood-based methods
      for MR and SAD phasing and has made a large impact, accelerating over the
      period 2008-2013.
      At the pharma giant, AstraZeneca, Phaser is considered the "tool of
      choice" for solving structures
      by MR.

    The conception and development of Phaser (and its predecessor Beast) have
      all taken place since
      Read became Professor of Protein Crystallography, on his arrival as a
      Wellcome Trust Principal
      Research Fellow at the Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge
      in 1998, though it
      continues a long-running theme of research into the application of
      likelihood to crystallography.
      The research towards the development of Phaser was led by Read and
      conducted by a team of
      post-doctoral researchers based in the Department of Haematology in the
      Cambridge Institute for
      Medical Research: Airlie McCoy (2000-present), Laurent Storoni
      (2001-2004), Hamsapriye (2004-2006),
      G&amp;#225;bor Bunk&amp;#243;czi (2007-present) and Robert Oeffner (2007-present).
    Traditional methods for solving protein crystal structures by molecular
      replacement (MR) suffer
      from a number of drawbacks, largely arising from the inability of these
      methods to take account of
      the effects of errors such as differences between the known structure and
      the unknown target.
      Maximum likelihood provides a way to account statistically for such
      errors; likelihood targets for MR
      searches were derived by Read and implemented in the computer program
      Beast, and were
      indeed shown to be significantly more sensitive (Read, 2001). Beast was
      very slow, but success in
      determining several difficult unsolved structures encouraged the
      development of a faster, more
      powerful new program, Phaser. Speed was increased by deriving and
      implementing fast
      approximations to the likelihood targets for orientation (Storoni et
        al., 2004) and translation
      searches (McCoy et al., 2005). Automation algorithms, built on the
      advantages of likelihood for
      decision-making, made it much easier to solve the structures of large
      complexes at the forefront of
      structural biology in both academia and industry. The first version of
      Phaser was released to the
      crystallographic community in late 2003, through open-source downloads to
      academic users, and
      to industrial users as part of the CCP4 and Phenix packages.
    The development of a likelihood target for the SAD phasing experiment
      (McCoy et al., 2004)
      next gave Phaser the power to solve novel structures with no prior
      structural knowledge.
      Facilitated by the unified underlying mathematical foundation of the MR
      and SAD likelihood targets,
      combined methods were developed and implemented, allowing different
      sources of information to
      be used together in solving particularly recalcitrant structures (McCoy et
        al., 2007; Read and
      McCoy, 2011).
    Phaser is still under continuous development in the Read lab to improve
      the algorithms and
      automation features. New versions are released formally, as part of the
      CCP4 and Phenix
      crystallographic software packages, about twice each year.
    The increased sensitivity of the likelihood targets in Phaser, compared
      to methods used previously,
      has opened new applications of the molecular replacement method. Read has
      collaborated to
      combine Phaser with the advanced modelling techniques of the Rosetta
      program (David Baker, the
      University of Washington), making it possible to solve crystal structures
      using ab initio folding
      models (Qian et al., 2007); with the further addition of automated
      rebuilding software (contributed
      by Tom Terwilliger, Los Alamos National Laboratory), structures could be
      solved with considerably
      more distantly-related starting models than previously possible (DiMaio 
        et al., 2011). Read is also
      collaborating with Isabel Us&amp;#243;n (Molecular Biology Institute of Barcelona)
      to strengthen her
      Arcimboldo procedure for ab initio structure solution, which uses
      Phaser to place small molecular
      fragments such as helices that seed completion of the rest of the
      structure.

    Aircraft icing consultancy company AeroTex was founded in 2002, as an SME
      offshoot from QinetiQ. Since 2008, it has used UCL's research to underpin
      its specialist icing work, ranging from ice accretion physics to the
      design and certification of ice protection systems [A].
    In 2010, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposed
      new aircraft icing regulations. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)
      followed suit in 2011, proposing a similar update to their certification
      specifications for large aeroplanes. Since then, aircraft manufacturers
      have been working to ensure their designs meet these specifications, as
      the proposals will come into force imminently.
    These proposals followed a number of accidents, including the October
      1994 crash of American Eagle Flight 4184, which rolled out of level flight
      and crashed into a field in Indiana, killing all 68 people on board.
      Investigations found that the accident was caused by a build-up of ice on
      the wings during icing conditions that included freezing rain, or
      supercooled large droplets (SLD). At the time, the FAA required aircraft
      to be tested and certified for flight in icing conditions, but the rules
      were aimed at much smaller cloud-droplet diameters. The importance of
      SLDs, and their significant splash effects, was unknown, and was not even
      considered when certifying aircraft. Accidents including Flight 4184 and
      many since then highlighted the inadequacy of the icing certification
      standards and led to lengthy, complex discussions between authorities,
      manufacturers and designers about introducing updated regulations, and how
      these would be prepared for. This then resulted in the FAA introducing its
      proposals for new regulations that include SLD and ice crystals.
    In 2002, the UCL group was asked by industry to conduct research into
      SLD. UCL's research described in section 2 helps AeroTex to design new ice
      protection systems that meet these regulatory requirements [A]. It also
      impacts upon AeroTex's customers by enabling them to operate aircraft more
      safely in icing conditions and to comply with improved safety legislation.
      The research came to influence AeroTex through research collaborations,
      including Research Associate placements, and meetings of the UK Icing
      Group, of which UCL and AeroTex are both members. The owner of AeroTex
      said: "We have been able to use the knowledge generated within our
      analysis phase so that there has certainly been a benefit to us. We flow
      the knowledge generated by UCL into designs for ice protection systems for
      commercial customers" [B].
    AeroTex makes use of UCL research when advising customers on whether ice
      protection is needed and when designing new ice protection systems that
      comply with future and current regulations. The UCL research findings are
      an important part of a portfolio of methods and evidence used to make
      decisions, and have directly influenced the course of development of
      AeroTex's AID (Aircraft Icing Design) analysis tool, used in aircraft ice
      protection system design. UCL research also helps AeroTex to stay ahead of
      their competitive rivals; the company has become experienced at providing
      consultancy for manufacturers who need to conform to the new certification
      rules [A].
    UCL's research has not only led to these important impacts on aircraft
      safety, but also has commercial benefits for AeroTex. [text removed for
      publication]
    AeroTex's customers are confidential, but include several aircraft
      manufacturers and Tier 1 (the top approved) equipment suppliers. New
      sub-system designs have already been or are to be incorporated into
      manufactured aircraft, and are estimated to be included on thousands of
      aircraft over many years. UCL research has helped both AeroTex and their
      customers to understand the effects of ice on planes, and the safety
      implications associated with icing. It has helped AeroTex provide system
      designs that comply with proposed new rules, and enabled them to compete
      effectively against their rivals, supporting improved aircraft safety for
      the future. The financial figures as far as the customers are concerned
      are confidential but extend into the hundreds of thousands of pounds
      sterling.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The consultancy company AeroTex makes use of UCL research findings to
      design new and improved ice protection systems for fixed wing or rotor

      manufacturers and Tier 1 equipment suppliers) to comply with upcoming
      changes that are raising aircraft certification standards and to operate
      aircraft more safely in icing conditions. The increase in income to
      AeroTex resulting from this work was approximately [text removed for

    Improving aircraft safety in icing conditions
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Mathematical Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    When an aircraft flies through cloud at or below freezing temperature,
      ice can accrete on its forward-facing parts. This can lead to detrimental
      performance, and has been a significant factor in a number of past
      incidents and accidents, some of which resulted in the loss of life. Icing
      occurs when supercooled water droplets suspended in the cloud impact on
      the body of the aircraft and freeze on to it. The rate, amount and
      location of ice accretion depend on parameters including temperature,
      speed, aircraft surface shape and droplet size. Existing mathematical
      models are reasonably accurate in predicting the shape and quantity of ice
      produced when droplets are small (&amp;#8804;40&amp;#956;m). However, for
      larger droplets (supercooled large droplets, or SLD) the models were
      inadequate and tended to dramatically over-predict the amount of ice
      produced and wrongly predict its location, partly because larger droplets
      tend to splash. This resulted in errors in predicting aerodynamic
      performance and safety.
    Accurate modelling of aircraft icing is desirable as it can inform the
      design of aircraft and ice protection systems, resulting in improved
      aircraft safety. Between 2001 and 2013 researchers in UCL's Department of
      Mathematics investigated and modelled various aspects of impacts of
      relevance to aircraft icing, taking larger droplets into account and
      ensuring that models are realistic. Work on asymptotic expansions and
      matching, involving complex multi-phase fluids, irregular geometry,
      air-water interactions, shallow-layer impacts and ice-skimming, produced
      reduced-equation computations and code supported by comparisons with
      real-world findings.
    Early work (2001-03) involved the development of models that simulate how
      a layer of air between a droplet and a water layer affects the impact of
      the droplet [1]; the effect of air on impacts &amp;#8212; vital for real-world
      applications &amp;#8212; had never been predicted before. Splashing of large
      droplets impacting onto a layer of water was then investigated in 2002 to
      2005 [2, 3], with parameters such as air flow, water depth and droplet
      size being varied. Findings included the first-ever predictions of surface
      roughness effects after impact and how much of the water layer is splashed
      away. Some of this work [3] was written up jointly with a group from the
      Mathematical Institute in Oxford, the University of Nottingham and the
      University of East Anglia, who had arrived simultaneously at the same
      research conclusions. This work was followed in 2006 to 2008 by modelling
      of impacts involving a solid body approaching another solid body with two
      fluids (air and water) between them [4]; in an aircraft icing scenario
      this corresponds to an ice crystal impacting upon a solid aircraft surface
      covered by a water layer.
    A related research strand (2008-13) involved skimming impacts and
      rebounds. A model was derived for a solid body (e.g. an ice crystal)
      undergoing an oblique skimming impact with a shallow liquid layer and then
      rebounding from it [5]; this work included explanations of both entries
      into and exits from water. An extension of this model included fluid-body
      interactions with multiple bodies and multiple impacts [6], of relevance
      to wind-blown ice particles travelling along an aircraft wing.
    The above research generated new and simpler computational methodology.
      It also provided flexible mathematical predictions of the precise extent
      of a splash, rebound duration, effects of surrounding air motion, and
      shapes resulting from ice accretion or melting, which take into account
      highly variable parameter values including droplet size, impact speed and
      angle of incidence.
    Site visits and discussions with QinetiQ and AeroTex, together with
      complementary experimental input from Cranfield University, were important
      for much of the above modelling work [1, 2, 3, 4].

    The impacts of the underpinning research have affected a wide range of
      beneficiaries at regional,
      national and international levels. The reach and significance of the
      impacts may be categorised as;
    Impacts on practitioners, professional services, local government and
        national
        specifications: Simons Group and NPS Ltd, acting as the industrial
      partners have directly
      benefited from the research and its outputs. For example, the Simons Group
      is using The Carbon
      Lifecycle Evaluation Assimilation Framework and its associated tool to
      benchmark projects at both
      feasibility and tender stage. Not only has this provided the Group with a
      useful aid in facilitating
      carbon conversations with their clients, it has enabled them to understand
      the impact of carbon in
      the projects they work on resulting in value engineering of both emissions
      and costs as stated in
      their website;
      http://www.simonsgroup.com/p/h/Building_Greener/Benchmarking_whole_life_carbon/512/?lang=
    In November 2007, concurrently with the KTP project with Simons Group,
      Sodagar with five
      partners (Simons Group, Davis Langdon, dcarbon8, Delta Simons and Total
      Flow) founded the
      Construction Emission Community of Practice (CECoP). CECoP is an inclusive
      voluntary group of
      consultants and academics working collaboratively on developing the
      protocols for calculating and
      understanding the carbon footprint of buildings. CECoP won the Royal
      Institute of British Architects
      (RIBA) East Midlands Special Award in 2008 for Architecture celebrating
      excellence in the region.
      CECoP collaborated with the Carbon Trust and Defra during the consultation
      stage of the
      development process for "Specification for the assessment of the life
      cycle greenhouse gas
      emissions of goods and services" (PAS2050), a publicly available
      specification which came into
      effect on 29 October 2008 (BSI October 2008, ISBN 978 0 580 50978 0).
    The impact of this research has gone beyond the immediate collaborative
      industrial partners.
      CECoP, for example, has organized a series of national symposia and one
      international
      conference targeting the industry to share and disseminate the research
      findings. These include;
    
      Timber Sequestration Symposium, 30th January 2009, Offices
        of Davis Langdon, London.
      Responsible Sourcing workshop, 22nd June 2009, Offices of
        Davis Langdon, London.
      Carbon Footprintng Symposium 1, 5th March 2008, Offices of Simons
        Group, Lincoln
      Carbon Footprinting Symposium 2, 2nd May 2008, Offices of
        Davis Langdon, London.
      Eco Deco Conference, 9th December 2008, University of
        Lincoln.
    
    Impact has also been achieved internationally. Examples of this include
      the UK-China Innovation
      Forum on Sustainable Building Technologies, held in Beijing and Shanghai
      in June 2011, at which
      Sodagar, as the invited speaker, presented both the research and the
      design tools.
    Carbon4CAST the innovative carbon management tool which has been created
      as part of the
      research carried out in collaboration with NPS Humber Ltd, employs a
      three-phase approach to
      help large organisations establish strategy plans, identify energy saving
      priorities, and optimise
      spending. It is currently being used to predict carbon emissions of Hull
      City Council's building
      portfolio (around 700 buildings). Following its success at the Ecobuild
      (see the following section),
      Carbon4CAST is utilised by NPS Humber Ltd to improve environmental
      performance of a range of
      their clients including large retail organisations. Carbon4CAST is also
      rolled out to 27 offices of
      NPS nationwide to accurately predict carbon emissions of their clients
      including city councils. NPS
      is involved in negotiations with Chinese central and local governments,
      including the Ministry of
      Energy and Climate Change, for the utilisation of Carbon4CAST to forecast
      and manage carbon
      reduction targets in China.
    Impact on raising awareness of the public: The research has
      substantially raised public
      awareness and acceptance of the potential of carbon management tools in
      reducing environmental
      impacts of buildings. Carbon4CAST was showcased as part of the Innovation
      Future Zone at
      Ecobuild, 5-7 March 2013 alongside other industry-leading inventions.
      Following a national
      competition, the tool received the Innovation Award at Ecobuild 2013,
      sponsored by the Modern
      Build Environment Knowledge Transfer Network, a network of government
      organisations that
      brings together the latest developments in the built environment.
    By invitation, Carbon4CAST was also exhibited at the Building Research
      Establishment (BRE)
      INSITE13 Conference and Exhibition on 2-3 October 2013. Here, the
      potential of the toolkit to
      predict and reduce carbon emissions was demonstrated to the construction
      industry, as it was
      showcased in the Exhibition Zone and the Innovation Park &amp;#8212; renowned for
      profiling new and
      emerging technologies.
    Impacts on the environment: The research has resulted in
      quantifiable carbon reductions of
      businesses and activities, which in turn reduce the impacts on
      environment. The Simons Group,
      for example, claims that during the period of research (2007-09) the
      Carbon Leaf has reduced their
      business carbon footprint by 25%, with much of this reduction being due to
      better planning for site
      energy needs and recording of site emissions, effectiveness of
      communicating transport policy,
      and energy awareness training.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The research reported in this case study demonstrates that in order to
      achieve a carbon neutral
      future whole life building carbon footprinting should be undertaken by
      using Life Cycle
      Assessments (LCA) at all stages of design, construction and throughout the
      lifespan of buildings.
      Practical tools in this area are few, and the award winning research
      projects reported here address
      this need and have had impacts in the following areas; firstly, through
      their direct applications in
      building procurement and management, secondly through changes to national
      standards and
      specifications and thus professional practice, and thirdly through
      enhanced public awareness at
      local, national and international levels.

    The underpinning research on carbon footprinting of buildings commenced
      in 2007 and is ongoing.
      The research examines the complete building lifecycle that can be
      understood for the purpose of
      carbon footprinting as having three distinct stages, namely initial
      impact, operational impact, and
      end of life impact.
    2.1 Context of the research: Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has
      become the currency of UK
      environmental marketing. The construction industry has become increasingly
      concerned about
      understanding the impact of buildings as different stakeholders in the
      industry are shifting their
      focus towards declaration of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon
      footprints of
      buildings, with an ultimate goal to become carbon neutral or even carbon
      positive.
    2.2 Current research gaps and how this research addresses them:
      Calculating emissions from
      the construction process and building use is a relatively new concern for
      the construction industry
      and published sources are limited. There are a number of carbon management
      tools available,
      however, not many of them apply the life cycle approach and few are
      suitable for use by the
      construction industry, mainly due to their different calculation
      methodology and region specific
      datasets. There is no viable standard toolkit.
    The research reported in this case study establishes two frameworks. The
      first framework
      proposes an assimilation methodology and toolkit with data, scope and
      boundary protocols to allow
      comparison of design scenarios within building type groups. The second
      framework offers a
      predictive modelling toolkit designed to help organisations with large
      property portfolios to reduce
      their carbon emissions. The frameworks support the formulation of
      environmental impact reduction
      strategies throughout the design, construction and management of buildings
      and support life cycle
      thinking in terms of design life, reuse and recycling necessary for
      optimising sustainability in the
      built environment.
    The Centre for Architectural Research in the Lincoln School of
      Architecture has developed the
      methodologies, frameworks and toolkits in partnership with industrial
      partners. They provide the
      construction industry with consistent approaches in order that benchmarks
      can be established and
      proposed design and buildings may be more readily compared and analysed.
      The research has
      inspired audiences to become increasingly aware of their carbon footprint,
      and to understand the
      changes that need to be made to our built environment to achieve a more
      sustainable future.
    2.3 Research objectives and aims
    
      To propose calculation methodologies and data collection procedures to
        ensure uniformity,
        consistency, transparency and accuracy in estimation of the carbon
        emissions of buildings.
      To enable design teams and facility managers to create and maintain
        low emission buildings
        across the whole life cycle of buildings.
      To enable best value cost benefit decision making alongside low
        carbon and other sustainability
        drivers.
    
    2.4 Research methodology: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a
      systematic approach to manage
      the potential environmental impacts of products and service systems. This
      philosophy towards
      meeting changing needs and mitigating risks can be compared to the
      research methodology of
      experiential learning. Precedent for this form of research design
      is rooted in the development of
      Change Theory in which the researcher is engaged in a reflective
      study of professional practice
      within a system, in the case for this impact case study, large
      architectural practices and
      organisations with large property portfolios. This research is also linked
      to the idea of pragmatic
      Action Research, which would be apparent in the implementation of
      the change to the collaborating
      professional practices that would be brought about by wide-scale adoption
      of good practice.
    2.5 Key research findings: The research has produced a family of
      carbon reduction management
      tools. Two selected tools are outlined here as examples;
    The Carbon Lifecycle Evaluation Assimilation Framework
      &amp;#8212; Carbon Leaf
      This toolkit was developed as part of a two-year KTP research project
      (2007-09) in association with
      Simons Group. The KTP Partnership has been graded `Very Good' by a panel
      of independent
      Assessors. The developed framework and its associated design toolkit have
      been used widely by
      that company to model building carbon footprint during the design process.
    Carbon4CAST, a Carbon Action Strategy Toolkit
      The toolkit was developed in association with NPS Humber Ltd as part of a
      two-year KTP research
      project (2011-13). The KTP Partnership has been graded `Outstanding', the
      highest rating
      possible, by a panel of independent Assessors. Carbon4CAST is a toolkit
      developed to assist
      businesses with large or complex property portfolios in their commitment
      to reduce carbon
      emissions. The tool received the esteemed award for innovation at Ecobuild
      2013.
    Among research findings are;
    
      Recognise and understand business's impacts
      Deal with biggest impacts first
      Design to manage both social and environmental impact
      Work with all stakeholders to continuously improve sustainable
        practice
    
    2.6 Research team: The on going research that underpins this case
      study was initiated as part of
      two Knowledge Transfer Partnership research grants whose outputs are
      widely recognised and
      which have won prestigious awards. The KTP with Simons Group (KTP006662,
      value &amp;#163;113,696)
      was supervised by Prof. Sodagar, Prof. Chilton and Philip Hyde (Chilton
      left the University of
      Lincoln in 2008). The industrial supervisor was Dr Rosi Fieldson of Simons
      Group. The KTP
      research associate was Deepak Rai. The KTP with NPS Ltd (KTP008021, value
      &amp;#163;110,000) was
      supervised by Prof. Sodagar, Dr Elnokaly and Simone Medio. The industrial
      supervisor was John
      Bell, while Dr Feifei Sun was the KTP associate.

    In 2007 the School started to collaborate with Brady Haran, then a&#xD;
      freelance BBC journalist, who had worked previously with the Nottingham&#xD;
      School of Chemistry on the production of short videos on the chemical&#xD;
      elements. This initiative arose from interest within the School to engage&#xD;
      with the wide and diverse audiences which can be accessed through new&#xD;
      forms of social media and mobile technology. Following the success of a&#xD;
      pilot phase in which several Physics-focused videos were featured on&#xD;
      Haran's Test Tube YouTube channel, which is aimed at a general&#xD;
      science audience, a decision was taken to launch the Sixty Symbols&#xD;
      YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols)&#xD;
      and website (www.sixtysymbols.com),&#xD;
      devoted entirely to physics-related topics. This activity serves the&#xD;
      strategic aim of providing a route through which the public can become&#xD;
      engaged with our research.&#xD;
    Since its launch in February 2009, Sixty Symbols has amassed&#xD;
      21.2M views and 266k subscribers and there are now 212 freely-available&#xD;
      videos (all figures quoted are up to 31st July 2013), each of&#xD;
      which consists of a commentary on a particular scientific topic by a&#xD;
      researcher from the School. Sixty Symbols was designed to present&#xD;
      the workings of a research-led physics department in a manner that engages&#xD;
      the viewer by giving them a sense of membership through the development of&#xD;
      themes, familiar faces, and a common informal style. This feeling of&#xD;
      community is reflected by the rapid growth in the number of Sixty&#xD;
        Symbols' subscribers and the high proportion of returning viewers,&#xD;
      evidenced by large numbers of comments and channel subscriptions. Sixty&#xD;
        Symbols is now ranked within the top 0.01% of the tens of millions&#xD;
      of YouTube channels by number of views. For comparison, the viewing&#xD;
      statistics for Sixty Symbols compare favourably with the highly&#xD;
      acclaimed CERNTV, the YouTube channel of CERN, a major&#xD;
      international organisation which attracts wide media interest: CERNTV&#xD;
      has attracted 3.3M views and 36k subscribers to 179 uploaded videos since&#xD;
      its launch in 2007.&#xD;
    The Sixty Symbols videos and viewing figures (31st July
      2013) related to the topics discussed in detail under the research section&#xD;
      on scanning probe microscopy (Section 2.1) are: Gold Nanoparticles&#xD;
      (72,627), Electrons (74,842), Nano (41,082), Wavefunction&#xD;
      (111,012), Vacuum Cannon (87,785), and Atomic Switch&#xD;
      (49,608). Those related to Galactic Astronomy (Section 2.2) are Plus&#xD;
        or Minus (54,451), Milky Way's Twin (41,370), Redshift&#xD;
      (47,248), Dark Matter (142,422) and Spiral Galaxies&#xD;
      (52,040). The videos may be readily accessed through an internet search on&#xD;
      `Sixty Symbols Videoname' and the viewing figures confirm the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this dissemination route for our research.&#xD;
    To assess further the impact of the Sixty Symbols project, the&#xD;
      School commissioned an independent evaluation by management consultants&#xD;
      O'Herlihy &amp;amp; Co [A] which was completed in 2013. This report is used&#xD;
      extensively below to provide supporting statistics and analysis of&#xD;
      audience interaction with Sixty Symbols. The report is based on:&#xD;
      data extracted from viewing statistics, audience comments appended to each&#xD;
      video [B], social media conversations, newspaper reports, stakeholder&#xD;
      interviews, teaching resources, and a student survey. The report confirms&#xD;
      the viewing figures above and makes the following additional points,&#xD;
    &#xD;
      99.4% positive feedback, quantified by viewers `liking' (positively&#xD;
        rating) the video content.&#xD;
      Geographical analysis of viewer statistics shows that Sixty&#xD;
          Symbols reaches a global audience across all continents with a&#xD;
        particular concentration in Australia, North America and Europe.&#xD;
      Prior to university study, 1st year undergraduates&#xD;
        reported that Sixty Symbols significantly raised their interest&#xD;
        in Physics (74%) and also raised their understanding of Physics (77%).&#xD;
      The large number of comments (over 7000 for some videos) provides&#xD;
        clear evidence of debate between the public and the researchers&#xD;
        themselves (including 100s of direct emails). Scientific debates arising&#xD;
        from Sixty Symbols videos are often followed up through other&#xD;
        social media sites such as Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/sixtysymbols)&#xD;
        and Twitter.&#xD;
      
Sixty Symbols has been used as a formal educational resource,&#xD;
        positively referenced by numerous teachers' support networks including;&#xD;
        Times Educational Supplement (TES), the California Learning Resource&#xD;
        Network and the Northern Illinois University [A].&#xD;
    &#xD;
    For a specific example of inclusion in core teaching material, see&#xD;
      reference [C] from a UK teacher in a secondary school who highlights the&#xD;
      importance of the link with research (in this case the topic of scanning&#xD;
      probe microscopy discussed in Section 2.1) in stating:&#xD;
    "....greatly enjoyed throughout our student population, around 130 at&#xD;
        A level studying for Physics. A key element of Sixty Symbols is the&#xD;
        symbiotic content of real research carried out with a physics&#xD;
        department, such as nanoscale microscopy, supported by discussion of the&#xD;
        underlying physics."&#xD;
    The educational influence of Sixty Symbols has also steered other&#xD;
      organisations in their approach to outreach and investment in new media.&#xD;
      In 2010, STFC commissioned a series of videos under the title of Backstage&#xD;
        Science (http://www.backstagescience.com)&#xD;
      to present their facilities using an approach similar to the Sixty&#xD;
        Symbols format. The open call for an STFC contract to shoot these&#xD;
      videos was won by a consortium headed by Merrifield (&amp;#163;70.5k,&#xD;
      2010), with further support (&amp;#163;18k) in 2012. These videos have had over&#xD;
      0.5M views, and the Backstage Science channel has 24,000&#xD;
      subscribers. STFC have estimated that this channel has been used by 3,000&#xD;
      teachers [A; see page 19].&#xD;
    The success of Sixty Symbols in delivering videos of high quality&#xD;
      and with educational value has been recognised by the invitation to Merrifield&#xD;
      to speak at the BrainSTEM `unconference' on YouTube science held&#xD;
      at the Perimeter Institute in 2012. Recognition has also come from Google:&#xD;
      "Sixty Symbols provides quality educational content on YouTube. The&#xD;
        videos have theories in physics and astronomy put forth so passionately&#xD;
        by experts in the fields, they serve as a very effective way to&#xD;
        propagate this knowledge." Global Head of Education Partnerships,&#xD;
      Google [D]&#xD;
    In an initiative to raise the quality of content on YouTube, Google [E]&#xD;
      funded Brady Haran to establish several new YouTube channels including Numberphile&#xD;
      related to mathematics and, in collaboration with the astronomy&#xD;
      researchers in the School, Deep Sky Videos. These new channels,&#xD;
      which build directly on the success of the Sixty Symbols project,&#xD;
      have already attracted over 30M views and 400k subscribers. To support&#xD;
      this additional activity, Brady Haran has recently formed "Periodic&#xD;
        Videos Ltd" (2011), securing the future for this style of&#xD;
      disseminating scientific research. Haran himself [E] notes the importance&#xD;
      of the role of research in the success of the videos:&#xD;
    "I believe this "real life researcher" discussion is what makes Sixty&#xD;
        Symbols so successful. The people in these films are "the real deal" at&#xD;
        the cutting edge of research &amp;#8212; and viewers respond to that!"&#xD;
    4.1 Comments and critical review by leading scientific communicators&#xD;
     Physics World [F]&#xD;
    "This is what online physics should look like.....professional but not&#xD;
      too slick...explained thoughtfully. The scientists skilfully avoid either&#xD;
      confusing or patronizing their audience".&#xD;
    Henry Reich, Perimeter Institute (producer of Minute Physics) [G]&#xD;
    "..Sixty Symbols is a particularly important channel because it shares&#xD;
      the real "on the ground" stories....increase public awareness and&#xD;
      understanding, but also to make science a more approachable and desirable&#xD;
      path for young students around the world."&#xD;
    Simon Singh (science writer) [H]&#xD;
    "Sixty Symbols is an excellent example of science engagement, reaching&#xD;
        large number so people (sic), using the internet in an effective manner,&#xD;
        and working within a modest budget. Others should pay attention and&#xD;
        learn from this model. With millions of videos viewed and over 100,000&#xD;
        comments, the project speaks for itself. Part of the reason for its&#xD;
        success is that the people behind Sixty Symbols regularly update with&#xD;
        fresh material, thus bringing cutting edge research direct to the&#xD;
        public. Perhaps the site's greatest achievement, after sheer volume of&#xD;
        traffic, is its ability to strike the right balance between serious&#xD;
        content and a flair for entertainment"&#xD;

    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    In collaboration with film-maker Brady Haran we have developed the&#xD;
      YouTube channel Sixty Symbols to present topics related to&#xD;
      research in physics to the wider public. Since the 2009 launch of Sixty&#xD;
        Symbols we have posted 212 videos, which have amassed 21.2M views,&#xD;
      over 200k comments, over 266k subscribers and a content approval rating of&#xD;
      99.4%, placing Sixty Symbols in the top 0.01% of all YouTube&#xD;
      channels. The success of Sixty Symbols led to commissions from&#xD;
      Google and STFC for the launch of additional science-focused YouTube&#xD;
      channels, and to the formation of the company Periodic Videos Ltd&#xD;
      by Brady Haran (2011). Quantitative evidence gathered by management&#xD;
      consultants, O'Herlihy &amp;amp; Co, demonstrates Sixty Symbols'&#xD;
      global reach, and significant impact on the attitudes, scientific&#xD;
      understanding and career aspirations of its audience. Overall the impact&#xD;
      has been on society, culture and creativity through the promotion of&#xD;
      public engagement and discourse on science and engineering, and through&#xD;
      educational use in schools.&#xD;

    The primary motivation within the School for the establishment of Sixty
        Symbols was to provide a new vehicle for the dissemination of our&#xD;
      research using social media, specifically YouTube videos, in order to&#xD;
      reach a much wider audience (demographically and geographically) than is&#xD;
      possible using conventional approaches to outreach.&#xD;
    Videos have now been delivered by 15 different researchers, including&#xD;
      academic staff, postdoctoral research assistants (PDRA) and PhD students,&#xD;
      who span all of the research groups within the School:&#xD;
    Astronomy: Almaini, Gray, Merrifield, Bauer (PDRA)&#xD;
    Cold Atoms &amp;amp; Quantum Optics: Kr03cbger&#xD;
    Condensed Matter Theory: Clewett (PhD/PDRA), Bowley&#xD;
      (Emeritus Professor), Fromhold&#xD;
    Experimental Condensed Matter and Nanoscience: Eaves, Hill,&#xD;
        Moriarty&#xD;
    Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Bowtell, Glover&#xD;
    Particle Theory: Copeland, Padilla&#xD;
    Accordingly, research across all areas within the School underpins Sixty
        Symbols, and the videos derive their authority from the expertise of&#xD;
      the featured researchers. The topics covered in many of the early videos&#xD;
      provide the context for our research activities, and built an audience&#xD;
      through the release of videos tackling problems of topical interest and&#xD;
      scientific curiosities. This platform has subsequently been used to&#xD;
      introduce videos that focus upon specific results arising from research&#xD;
      within the School. In particular, videos focusing on specific research&#xD;
      outputs in the areas of nanoscience [1], galactic astronomy [2],&#xD;
      magnetoscience [3], soft matter [4,5] and theoretical particle physics [6]&#xD;
      have been produced. To illustrate our approach, we describe below two&#xD;
      areas of research which have been successfully translated into series of Sixty
        Symbols videos.&#xD;
    2.1 Scanning probe microscopy: In a series of papers dating back&#xD;
      to 1995, Moriarty has investigated the use of scanning probes to&#xD;
      manipulate and image single molecules and atoms on silicon surfaces. The&#xD;
      initial focus was on the use of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to&#xD;
      position single C60 molecules on silicon surfaces at room&#xD;
      temperature. Following the purchase of a SRIF3-funded low temperature,&#xD;
      ultra-high vacuum atomic force microscope (AFM) in 2008, Moriarty&#xD;
      subsequently used AFM to toggle the state of Si dimers [1] and image&#xD;
      molecular orbitals of fullerene molecules (with support from EPSRC [i]).&#xD;
      This work has been translated to the Sixty Symbols project through&#xD;
      the initial posting of videos on background material in condensed matter&#xD;
      and surface physics: the video Gold Nanoparticles provides an&#xD;
      introduction to crystal structure, electron microscopy and nanoparticles;&#xD;
      Electrons introduces the wave nature of particles, including&#xD;
      electron diffraction from a silicon surface; Nano provides an&#xD;
      introduction to STM and nanoscience; Wave Function provides&#xD;
      background information on probability amplitude and describes the&#xD;
      molecular orbitals of C60; Vacuum Cannon introduces&#xD;
      vacuum technology. These videos contain many references to, and&#xD;
      explanations of, relevant experimental techniques and provide contextual&#xD;
      information for videos which focus on specific research outputs, such as&#xD;
      the AFM manipulation of Si atoms discussed in [1] and the video Atomic&#xD;
        Switch (manipulating a single atom).&#xD;
    2.2 Galactic Astronomy: Merrifield has been studying the&#xD;
      rates at which patterns rotate in galaxies since 1995, and this work has&#xD;
      resulted in 7 refereed publications to date, including [2], with support&#xD;
      from STFC [ii]. Measurements of this wave phenomenon have significant&#xD;
      implications for the way in which galaxies evolve and may even provide new&#xD;
      insight into the distribution of dark matter in galaxies. Merrifield&#xD;
      described many of the properties of galaxies in the videos Plus or&#xD;
        Minus (looking at the distance scale in the Milky Way), Redshift&#xD;
      (Milky Way merger with Andromeda), Dark Matter (looking at the&#xD;
      existence and distribution of dark matter in the Universe) and Milky&#xD;
        Way's Twin (spiral structure, etc. in a galaxy very like our own),&#xD;
      as well as in videos on the sister Deep Sky Videos channel (see&#xD;
      Section 4). This allowed us to present his recent work [2] on measuring&#xD;
      pattern speeds and their variation with radius in spiral galaxies, as well&#xD;
      as galaxy bar pattern speeds, in the video Spiral Galaxies.&#xD;
    In addition, we have released background videos related to cold atoms,&#xD;
      magnetic levitation, graphene, magnetic resonance imaging and&#xD;
      semiconductor physics which will provide the relevant background physics&#xD;
      for a further phase of videos focusing on specific research results.&#xD;

    The use of UCL research to develop ICE-GB and later the IGE website has&#xD;
      provided an innovative,&#xD;
      free resource for English grammar teaching and learning which has&#xD;
      profoundly enhanced&#xD;
      educational opportunities and standards both within and beyond formal&#xD;
      education systems, all&#xD;
      around the world. Since its inception in 1998, the IGE website has&#xD;
      attracted 3.7m users worldwide;&#xD;
      between 2008 and 2013 it reached more than 1.2m users, including a core of&#xD;
      over 215,000 repeat&#xD;
      users.&#xD;
    Provision of an educational resource for individual learners around&#xD;
        the world&#xD;
      There is a long tradition of using artificial,&#xD;
      invented examples to illustrate grammatical&#xD;
      phenomena to learners (e.g. The cat sat on the&#xD;
        mat.). However, teachers and learners find the&#xD;
      artificiality of these examples a barrier to their&#xD;
      ability to get to grips with how grammar applies&#xD;
      to real life. The IGE website and iGE app&#xD;
      remedy this problem by making use of&#xD;
      authentic examples sourced from the ICE-GB&#xD;
      corpus to help learners acquire real English.&#xD;
      The IGE website is freely available and has&#xD;
      received over 1.3m hits since 2008 (over 3.7m&#xD;
      hits since inception in 1998). These range from&#xD;
      184,046 to 337,561 per year. Visits from&#xD;
      unique users range from 149,642 to 298,089&#xD;
      per year while 30-50,000 per year are repeat&#xD;
      users, totalling over 215,000 repeat users since 2008. Although overall&#xD;
      page hits declined from&#xD;
      2008 to 2011, they were on the rise again through 2012 and the first half&#xD;
      of 2013 [1]. The website&#xD;
      brings key insights from UCL's long history of research into English&#xD;
      grammar use to global users,&#xD;
      as shown by the chart below, which demonstrates its appeal in the world's&#xD;
      biggest markets for&#xD;
      English learning.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    &#xD;
    &#xD;
    As a direct extension and further development of the IGE website, the iGE&#xD;
      app sustains and&#xD;
      expands IGE's impacts on beneficiaries in the non-academic educational&#xD;
      sector and in the&#xD;
      commercial sector by expanding its reach from the web to an easily&#xD;
      accessible offline app. The&#xD;
      iGE app is available in both free and paid versions. It has been&#xD;
      downloaded by over 34,500 users&#xD;
      who can now access innovative grammar lessons and exercises any time,&#xD;
      anywhere. The paid&#xD;
      version has been downloaded by around 3,500 users (Apple version &amp;#163;4.99,&#xD;
      Android version &amp;#163;2.99)&#xD;
      and the free version by over 31,000 users [1]. The app helps maintain&#xD;
      IGE's global reach and user-base:&#xD;
	  while the paid versions of the app are largely accessed in OECD&#xD;
      countries such as the UK,&#xD;
      US, and Australia, the free versions allow access to the vast number of&#xD;
      people in non-OECD&#xD;
      countries who are interested in learning English. Thus, the free version&#xD;
      of the Apple app has a&#xD;
      significantly higher proportion of downloaders from non-OECD countries,&#xD;
      and while downloaders of&#xD;
      the paid version are based in only 33 different non-OECD countries, those&#xD;
      for the free version&#xD;
      come from 74 [1].&#xD;
    &#xD;
    &#xD;
    Note: The Google Store only gives the top ten countries from which apps have been downloaded.&#xD;
     Thus &amp;#8216;Others&amp;#8217; may include both OECD and non-OECD countries.&#xD;
     &#xD;
    Note: The Google Store only gives the top ten countries from which&#xD;
      apps have been downloaded.&#xD;
      Thus `Others' may include both OECD and non-OECD countries.&#xD;
    In July 2013, the iGE app had a rating of 5 stars (the highest possible&#xD;
      rating) on both the Apple&#xD;
      App and the Google Play stores. Reviewers described it as: `Authoritative&#xD;
      (as you would expect&#xD;
      from UCL), comprehensive, clear and informative...' [2], and noted&#xD;
      appreciation for the wide range&#xD;
      of materials it included: `Even in the free version', one reviewer wrote,&#xD;
      `there is both scholarly yet&#xD;
      easy to understand content about key aspects of English grammar, as well&#xD;
      as very useful&#xD;
      exercises...The full glossary included is easy to use and a fantastic&#xD;
      reference for students of all&#xD;
      levels. It is clear that this is the product of university-level work,&#xD;
      made accessible to all kinds of&#xD;
      users.' The app has also been positively reviewed elsewhere, including:&#xD;
      Linguistics Research&#xD;
        Digest; iPad English (`an essential purchase for iPad-owning&#xD;
      English teachers... more advanced&#xD;
      EFL/ESL students should also find it useful`) [4]; David Crystal's blog&#xD;
      (`The model presented is a&#xD;
      well-established and influential one, and there are lots of real examples&#xD;
      of usage') [5]; Emphasis&#xD;
        Business Writing Trainers; and the English Editing blog,&#xD;
      which described it as `an essential&#xD;
      acquisition for iPad-owning English teachers and more advanced learners'&#xD;
      and listed iGE in its top&#xD;
      10 apps for learners of English [6]. The most recent review on Google Play&#xD;
      remarks: `This is a&#xD;
      great way to refresh grammatical knowledge for adults....The best part is&#xD;
      the large number of&#xD;
      practice exercises that give great feedback and teach through the errors.&#xD;
      ... Worth 10x the cost.&#xD;
      Thank you for making such a quality learning tool' [3].&#xD;
    Provision of a new resource supporting English language teaching&#xD;
      Both the website and the app support individual study, and have provided&#xD;
      an important and freely&#xD;
      available resource for English language teachers the worldwide. Both are&#xD;
      recommended on the&#xD;
      BBC's `Learning English' site, while the IGE website has been recommended&#xD;
      for use by English&#xD;
      language teachers by, among others: the British Council, Macmillan&#xD;
      Dictionaries Online, Guardian&#xD;
      Education Online, Palgrave Study Skills, English Teaching in the UK,&#xD;
      Intute, BUBL English&#xD;
      Language Education, and UsingEnglish.com. Accordingly, it was noted in the&#xD;
      Guardian in 2011&#xD;
      that: `[T]his excellent site offers a detailed and clear course in English&#xD;

      undergraduates' [7].&#xD;
    The iGE app has also provided a useful learning resource to accompany&#xD;
      professional educational&#xD;
      courses both within and beyond the UK. For example, it now comprises a&#xD;
      central part of the&#xD;
      curriculum for undergraduate modules in English grammar at University of&#xD;
      York [8] and at Montclair&#xD;
      State University (USA). At MSU, the app is the only required resource for&#xD;
      students enrolled in&#xD;
      `Structure of American English', which in turn is a required course for&#xD;
      all undergraduates in&#xD;
      Linguistics, including those working towards certification in English as a&#xD;
      Second Language [9].&#xD;
    English Language Teaching is a huge growing industry worldwide, described&#xD;
      in 2006 as second&#xD;
      only to North Sea oil in its importance to the British economy [10]. The&#xD;
      SEU has contributed to the&#xD;
      global market in English teaching through its sale of licences of the IGE&#xD;
      website. Since January&#xD;
      2008, 13 such licenses for offline access to the IGE website were&#xD;
      purchased by a number of&#xD;
      companies and individuals [10].&#xD;

    We used the research consolidated in the British Component of the&#xD;
      International Corpus of English&#xD;
      (ICE-GB) to build the Internet Grammar of English (IGE), a&#xD;
      web-based introductory English&#xD;
      grammar; and an app for smartphones and tablets, called the interactive&#xD;
        Grammar of English&#xD;
      (iGE). The app is based on the IGE website, but was fully updated with new&#xD;
      materials and&#xD;
      exercises. Both resources have had educational and commercial impact as&#xD;
      tools for English&#xD;
      language teaching, reaching over 1.2 million users in 2008-2013 through&#xD;
      the website and over&#xD;
      34,500 through the app.&#xD;

    UCL's Survey of English Usage (SEU) research centre carries out research&#xD;
      in English Corpus&#xD;
      Linguistics, specifically English grammar: instituted in 1959, it was the&#xD;
      first centre in Europe to&#xD;
      undertake this type of research. Between 1990 and 1997, the SEU created&#xD;
      the British Component&#xD;
        of the International Corpus of English (ICE-GB) (www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/projects/ice-gb)&#xD;
      [a].&#xD;
      The grammatically analysed collection of language samples on ICE-GB&#xD;
      contains a combined total&#xD;
      of around 1 million words of written and spoken English, some 600,000 of&#xD;
      which are fully parsed&#xD;
      (grammatically analysed) examples of spoken English. As one of the largest&#xD;
      collections currently&#xD;
      available anywhere in the world, the corpus has been, and continues to be,&#xD;
      an indispensable data-mining&#xD;
	  resource for anyone interested in the grammar and linguistic&#xD;
      features of both the spoken&#xD;
      and written word. Complex and detailed searches of the corpus can be&#xD;
      conducted using its&#xD;
      innovative and world-leading exploration software ICECUP (International&#xD;
      Corpus of English Corpus&#xD;
      Utility Program): designed and developed at the SEU, ICECUP was originally&#xD;
      released in 1998;&#xD;
      version 2 was released in 2006. Using ICECUP, instances of grammatical and&#xD;
      lexical constructions&#xD;
      can be extracted from the corpus in intelligent ways, and to ascertain&#xD;
      linguistic trends including&#xD;
      contextual and frequency data for a vast array of linguistic features in&#xD;
      actual use. In 2002, SEU&#xD;
      researchers published a comprehensive reference to ICE-GB, including the&#xD;
      use of ICECUP [b].&#xD;
    The research was funded by a number of grants (ESRC, Leverhulme Trust,&#xD;
      and British Sasakawa&#xD;
      Foundation), whose Principal Investigators were Professor Sidney&#xD;
      Greenbaum, Dr Mark Huckvale&#xD;
      and Sean Wallis, all of UCL during the research period.&#xD;
    In 1998 the Survey of English Usage used the grammatical annotation of&#xD;
      spoken and written&#xD;
      English in ICE-GB to develop the IGE website. The website's enduring&#xD;
      popularity led, in 2011, to&#xD;
      the provision of funding from UCL Business PLC for the development of the&#xD;
      iGE smartphone/&#xD;
      tablet app. This was launched for Apple devices in 2011, an Android&#xD;
      version following in 2012. The&#xD;
      IGE website was developed in a project funded by the Joint Information&#xD;
      Systems Committee (JISC;&#xD;
      grant reference JTAP 2/247), whose Principal Investigators were Professor&#xD;
      Bas Aarts and Dr&#xD;
      Douglas Arnold (University of Essex), with research conducted primarily at&#xD;
      the SEU. Alongside&#xD;
      Professor Aarts, UCL researchers working on this project included Dr&#xD;
      Gerald Nelson (Deputy&#xD;
      Director of the SEU, 2004-2007, currently Professor of English Linguistics&#xD;
      at Chinese University of&#xD;
      Hong Kong), and Justin Buckley (researcher in the SEU, 1995-1998).&#xD;
    The development of the ICE-GB and, subsequently, of the IGE website was&#xD;
      both supported by and&#xD;
      itself fed into broader research undertaken within UCL's Department of&#xD;
      English. This has included&#xD;
      the production of numerous reference grammars based on Survey of English&#xD;
      Usage corpora, both&#xD;
      the ICE-GB corpus and others. Such grammars include Sidney Greenbaum's Oxford&#xD;
        English&#xD;
        Grammar (1996, based on ICE-GB), and Bas Aarts's Oxford Modern&#xD;
        English Grammar (2011; also&#xD;
      based on ICE-GB) [c].&#xD;

    The BPNRC conducts research assessing the effects of nutritional&#xD;
      interventions on brain function.&#xD;
      Although fully independent, BPNRC staff work closely with industrial&#xD;
      partners, including leading&#xD;
      global manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. Research income since&#xD;
      the inception of the&#xD;
      BPNRC in late 2007 totals more than &amp;#163;2 million, working with more than 10&#xD;
      companies (such as&#xD;
      Beneo, GSK, Kellogg's, Vitabiotics) on more than 20 studies. As such, much&#xD;
      of our work is directly&#xD;
      conceived to have an impact on our partners, most often in terms of&#xD;
      bolstering product value and&#xD;
      turnover by demonstrating efficacy, or by facilitating the development of&#xD;
      new products. In turn,&#xD;
      these products can be used by consumers to bring health benefits through&#xD;
      improved lifestyle and&#xD;
      wellbeing. Below are examples of how our research translates into&#xD;
      commercial benefits for two&#xD;
      international companies.&#xD;
    Bayer Consumer Healthcare (Basel) manufactures several leading global&#xD;
      brands of multi-vitamin/mineral&#xD;
      supplements. Whilst significant proportions of the populations of&#xD;
      developed&#xD;
      societies have been shown to have inadequate micro-nutrient status that&#xD;
      might be rectified by&#xD;
      these and similar products, little research has actually been conducted&#xD;
      investigating their efficacy.&#xD;
      The management of Bayer assessed the potential impact that direct evidence&#xD;
      of the efficacy of&#xD;
      their products would have on consumer behaviour (i.e. that credibility&#xD;
      would translate into sales)&#xD;
      and decided to sponsor research investigating the efficacy of Berocca&amp;#8482; and&#xD;
      Supradyn&amp;#8482; with&#xD;
      regards to cognitive function and psychological state. The subsequent&#xD;
      research demonstrated that&#xD;
      both products could improve mood/mental health and/or cognitive&#xD;
      performance in healthy,&#xD;
      employed adults (Haskell et al. 2010; Kennedy et al. 2010, 2011). This&#xD;
      research has been widely&#xD;
      used by Bayer who in a statement to Northumbria University confirm they&#xD;
      have used this "on brand&#xD;
        internet sites, company's intranet sites and pharmacy literature",&#xD;
      and to support "road shows,&#xD;
        media events and marketing brochures for health care professionals".&#xD;
      Bayer also confirms that&#xD;
      BPNRC research is also cited in the "registration dossiers (clinical&#xD;
        overviews) of Berocca&#xD;
        Performance and Supradyn" where they are registered for&#xD;
      over-the-counter sales. Where it has&#xD;
      been allowed by governmental regulatory authorities (e.g. Australia,&#xD;
      Philippines, Taiwan) the&#xD;
      BPNRC data have been further used as evidence to support direct health&#xD;
      claims and Bayer have&#xD;
      used statements such as "clinically proven formula" in&#xD;
      advertising, bolstering the credibility and&#xD;
      therefore sales of the products.&#xD;
    Bayer state that the research conducted by the BPNRC has increased the&#xD;
      value of their two&#xD;
      brands and has been instrumental in the growth in global uptake of both&#xD;
      products, with an estimate&#xD;
      of the contribution in the &amp;#163;10s millions since 2010. The initial&#xD;
      management decision to proceed with&#xD;
      the research projects was taken on the basis of forecasts of potential&#xD;
      growth and product value&#xD;
      and Bayer are satisfied that these expectations have been met. Indeed&#xD;
      Bayer state that, "the&#xD;
        collaboration of Bayer with the BPNRC is crucial for the continued&#xD;
        success of our products".&#xD;
    The pharmaceutical company Boehringer-Ingelheim has sponsored BPNRC&#xD;
      research investigating&#xD;
      the effects of guaran&amp;#225; on mental function (2003-2004). Subsequently,&#xD;
      Cognitive Drug Research&#xD;
      Ltd sponsored a PhD programme (2004-2008) that included further research&#xD;
      into the effects of&#xD;
      guaran&amp;#225;. This research confirmed the benefits to cognitive function seen&#xD;
      in the previous research&#xD;
      and showed that this was not as a consequence of guaran&amp;#225;'s caffeine&#xD;
      content. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      resultant publications (Kennedy et al. 2004, Haskell et al. 2007) were&#xD;
      used by Bayer Consumer&#xD;
      Healthcare, in consultation with the BPNRC, as evidence supporting a major&#xD;
      investment in the&#xD;
      development of a multi-vitamin/guaran&amp;#225; product, Berocca Boost&amp;#8482;. This&#xD;
      product was then tested&#xD;
      within the BPNRC and the results confirmed the previous observations of&#xD;
      acute improvements to&#xD;
      attention/executive function task performance (Kennedy et al. 2008).&#xD;
      Berocca Boost&amp;#8482; was&#xD;
      subsequently launched in 2008 and is currently marketed in the UK and nine&#xD;
      other countries&#xD;
      (including France, Spain and Singapore) and has generated extensive sales.&#xD;
      Bayer confirm that&#xD;
      this "globally represents a substantial amount of total Berocca sales"&#xD;
      and BPNRC have played "a&#xD;
        substantial role in their commercial success". The underpinning&#xD;
      research conducted in the BPNRC&#xD;
      not only provided the evidence on ingredient selection needed to drive a&#xD;
      major investment in&#xD;
      product development by Bayer, but has also been key to the success of the&#xD;
      product, which is being&#xD;
      rolled out globally over the coming years. The underpinning research has&#xD;
      also been used as direct&#xD;
      evidence supporting product claims in several countries.&#xD;
    Conversely, research conducted within the BPNRC has demonstrated a lack&#xD;
      of efficacy for other&#xD;
      products: for instance, the omega-3 fatty acids that were widely purported&#xD;
      to benefit cognitive&#xD;
      function in children. The largest (of several) studies within the BPNRC&#xD;
      investigating omega-3s&#xD;
      confirmed the lack of effect previously seen in children in a larger&#xD;
      sample of adults (Jackson et al.&#xD;
      2012) and led to the sponsoring organisation (Pharmaton SA, now Ginsana&#xD;
      SA) shelving plans to&#xD;
      develop omega-3 based products for improved cognitive function.&#xD;

    The Brain, Performance and Nutrition Research Centre (BPNRC) has an&#xD;
      international reputation&#xD;
      for research conducted in collaboration with industry to assess the impact&#xD;
      of nutrition and dietary&#xD;
      interventions on brain function. Our research benefits our industrial&#xD;
      partners financially, in terms of&#xD;
      increased product sales, and by providing evidence supporting the&#xD;
      introduction of new products&#xD;
      that improve consumer wellbeing. This case study focuses on research that&#xD;
      supported Bayer to&#xD;

      conducts research assessing the effects of nutritional and dietary&#xD;
      interventions, including essential&#xD;
      nutrients, food supplements and herbal extracts, on behaviour and aspects&#xD;
      of brain function.&#xD;
      Published work has included demonstrations of the positive health and&#xD;
      wellbeing effects of diverse&#xD;
      products such as cocoa flavanols, ginseng, vitamins, and terpenoid&#xD;
      extracts of sage (Salvia); and&#xD;

      cognitive performance and&#xD;
      mood. BPNRC research provides a strong evidence base to inform product&#xD;
      development, or&#xD;
      enhance the value and turnover of existing products by providing evidence&#xD;
      of efficacy. Examples of&#xD;
      each of these are provided below.&#xD;
    Product Efficacy&#xD;
    Vitamin/mineral supplements are by far the most widely taken food&#xD;
      supplements globally, with&#xD;
      more than one third of the adult population of the USA reporting their&#xD;
      use. Multi-vitamins make up&#xD;
      the majority of these products and yet this class of products has&#xD;
      attracted negligible research&#xD;
      interest. To improve the evidence base for supplement effects, a series of&#xD;
      projects were run during&#xD;
      2009-10 within the BPNRC which assessed the efficacy of existing&#xD;
      multi-vitamin products with&#xD;
      regards to aspects of subjective psychological state and cognitive&#xD;
      function (as assessed by&#xD;
      sensitive computerised cognitive assessments). In the first of these&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials (Kennedy et al. 2010), four weeks of supplementation with Bayer's&#xD;
      Berocca&amp;#8482;&#xD;
      multi-vitamin/mineral in healthy male adults (N = 215) was shown to&#xD;
      improve both cognitive&#xD;
      function and subjective ratings of stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and&#xD;
      mental health (GHQ-12).&#xD;
      Subsequently, nine weeks' administration of Supradyn&amp;#8482;&#xD;
      multi-vitamin/mineral to healthy adult&#xD;
      females (N = 210) was shown to improve performance on a computerised&#xD;
      multi-tasking battery,&#xD;
      reduce task related fatigue and lower homocysteine levels (Haskell et al.&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
      Conversely, the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid&#xD;
      (EPA) have garnered enormous interest on account of their assumed&#xD;
      beneficial effects on brain&#xD;
      function, particularly in children. Following on from research conducted&#xD;
      within the BPNRC for&#xD;
      Martek Biosciences, which showed no effect of DHA on cognitive function in&#xD;
      children, a series of&#xD;
      studies were conducted in healthy adults for Pharmaton SA (now Ginsana SA)&#xD;
      as part of an&#xD;
      industrially sponsored PhD (Philippa Jackson PhD awarded at Northumbria,&#xD;
      2010). These studies,&#xD;
      conducted in 2007-2009 (e.g. Jackson et al. 2012), again showed no&#xD;
      beneficial cognitive or mood&#xD;
      effects of differing ratios of DHA:EPA and led to the sponsoring&#xD;
      organisation refocusing their&#xD;
      product development elsewhere.&#xD;
    Product development&#xD;
    Guaran&amp;#225; (Paullinia cupana) is a commonly consumed South American&#xD;
      plant extract that is often&#xD;
      added to drinks and foods as a natural source of caffeine. The first study&#xD;
      in 2003-2004 assessed&#xD;
      the psychoactive effects of guaran&amp;#225; (alone and in combination with&#xD;
      ginseng) (Kennedy et al. 2004).&#xD;
      This research showed, for the first time, that guaran&amp;#225; could improve&#xD;
      performance of tasks&#xD;
      assessing attention and executive function, an effect that was unlikely to&#xD;
      be attributable to the low&#xD;
      caffeine content of the extract employed in the study. This led to a&#xD;
      further dose-ranging study in&#xD;
      2006 as part of an industrially sponsored PhD (Haskell, sponsor&#xD;
      Cognitive Drug Research Ltd).&#xD;
      This study confirmed (Haskell et al. 2007), on the basis of non-linear&#xD;
      dose response relationships,&#xD;
      that the psychoactive effects of guaran&amp;#225; were not directly attributable to&#xD;
      the extract's caffeine&#xD;
      content. A further study in 2006 (Kennedy et al. 2008) assessed the&#xD;
      psychoactive effects of a novel&#xD;
      product comprising a multi-vitamin with added guaran&amp;#225;. This study once&#xD;
      again confirmed acute&#xD;
      improvements in attention task performance and subjective fatigue.&#xD;

    The study findings of Abt, Siegler, Akubat, and Castagna (2011) suggest
      that coaches and/or athletes will need to adapt training methods depending
      on the likely distance that athletes are required to regularly perform.
      This knowledge has proved to be valuable throughout the sport science
      field, contributing to incremental and cumulative advances in training
      methods.
    Akubat and Abt (2011) suggest coaches and/or sports scientists will need
      to adjust their training load recommendations depending on whether the
      athlete is adopting a continuous or intermittent exercise. The research
      findings have implications for the development of injury or overtraining
      and should therefore be considered when monitoring player loads. The
      studies in 2012 and 2013 demonstrate the superiority of the iTRIMP method
      of monitoring training load with respect to previously established methods
      and how an integration of internal and external load could be used more
      effectively.
    The publication of these papers has generated international interest. The
      research is impacting on practices at the highest level of competition in
      English football. Akubat is currently working directly with three
      professional football clubs in the UK (Coventry City FC, Stoke City FC and
      Crystal Palace FC) and a professional Rugby Super League team (Hull
      Kingston Rovers). He has also supported a team in Ghana (Red Bull Ghana
      FC) who contacted him for help implementing the iTRIMP method. Workshops
      held at Newman University and in conjunction with Bradford Bulls Rugby
      League FC that have been run by Akubat have been attended by over 30
      coaches from professional football or rugby clubs in the UK, Finland and
      the USA.
    In addition to this, North American interest is his work has led to the
      organisation of a series of webinars, which were run on 2 and 3 July 2013
      with Major League Soccer team coaches amongst those in the audience.
    Akubat's research in the field and dissemination of this work has had two
      major impacts. Coaches are now educated to a greater degree about training
      load and secondly where coaches are in a position to change their
      approach, where they have backing and the finances, they are implementing
      this new method with their respective squads of players. For example, the
      Sports Science and Athletic Development (Academy) at Stoke City FC
      reported that they are in the process of implementing the iTRIMP "to aid
      their monitoring process with their academy players" (e-mail dated
      31/07/2013). Furthermore, Academy Sports Science at Coventry City FC has
      worked with Akubat for three years and has used the iTRIMP method
      throughout its development. They stated that Akubat's research had
      impacted on how coaches and sports scientists at Coventry City FC
      "understand the training process in our players and we changed our
      training accordingly".
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The Case Study focuses on the work of Ibrahim Akubat, an exercise
      physiologist lecturer who joined the department in 2010. Based on his
      research, Akubat has enabled a range of clubs to monitor accurately
      players' training loads and understand their footballers' training
      outcomes. Akubat's research shows the superiority of the new
      individualised training load monitoring method over existing methods of
      monitoring internal training load and exercise dose in intermittent
      sports. This has led to coaches from numerous professional clubs,
      including those from the English Premier League, attending workshops to
      seek guidance on modifying their approaches to training load monitoring.

    Akubat's research, which complements the `Physiological, biomechanical
      and psychological aspects of sports performance' research team at Newman
      University, shows the superiority of a new method of monitoring internal
      training load (Individualised Training Impulse &amp;#8212; iTRIMP) over methods that
      are still being used in research as criterion measures (Akubat, Barrett,
      Patel &amp;amp; Abt, 2012). Akubat identifies the limitations of those methods
      such as rating of perceived exertion (RPE), Edwards Training Impulse
      (TRIMP) &amp;amp; Banisters TRIMP in his publications. He also argues that the
      use of new technology such as GPS tracking devices cannot solely provide
      sufficient, appropriate and accurate information on the training load.
      This has led to his latest paper which shows the integration of iTRIMP and
      GPS measurements is better than just the use of GPS alone (Akubat, Barrett
      &amp;amp; Abt 2013).
    Research into the calculation of training impulse (TRIMP) in team sport
      players following intermittent exercise concludes that the determination
      of TRIMP from the change in the Heart Rate to Blood Lactate relationship
      (derived from a continuous exercise protocol) may underestimate the
      exercise `dose' of training and/or matches in team sport players (Akubat
      et al, 2011). As this underestimation is most prominent at the highest
      intensities, the absolute exercise intensity and/or the time spent at
      these high intensities should be lowered if a given TRIMP is to be
      achieved. Alternatively, if the absolute exercise intensity and/or time
      spent at these high intensities are maintained, then the actual `dose'
      will be higher than that which is recorded. This might have implications
      for the development of injury or overtraining. Therefore the research
      advocates that this should be considered when monitoring player loads.

The local Scottish company, ADMIT Design, used&#xD;      the FLCOS demonstrator to attract interest and investment. ADMIT was then&#xD;      bought by Central Research Laboratories of Thorn EMI, forming MicroPix&#xD;      Technologies Ltd in 1998. They developed the FLCOS microdisplay technology&#xD;      into a commercial product. Subsequently in 1995, in a joint venture with&#xD;      PicVue Electronics a pilot production company, Microvue, was created in&#xD;      Scotland, and an investment of &amp;#163;20m was raised to build a volume&#xD;      production plant in Taiwan.&#xD;    ForthDD [S1], is the successor company of MicroPix and MicroVue, founded&#xD;      in 2005, and based in Dalgety Bay, Fife. They succeeded in bringing the&#xD;      technology to production demonstrating that FLCOS microdisplays could be&#xD;      made to adequate standard in wafer scale production. Since its formation,&#xD;      and over the period of the REF impact window, it has raised in excess of&#xD;      US $33M in investment including the 2011 injection of US $14M by the&#xD;      leading US microdisplay company, Kopin Corporation [S2]. ForthDD designs,&#xD;      develops and manufactures single chip micro-displays used in the most&#xD;      demanding segments of markets such as training and simulation systems, HD&#xD;      video camera viewfinders, medical imaging systems and virtual-reality and&#xD;      head-mounted displays. Entirely digital, providing 24-bit full colour&#xD;      images, and capable of handling high-speed motion with no visible&#xD;      artefacts, Forth DD's single chip imagers are especially well-matched to&#xD;      the new solid state LED and laser diode light sources and provide very&#xD;      high native resolution. In late 2012, ForthDD reaffirmed its position as&#xD;      the world's leading supplier of advanced microdisplays when it released&#xD;      the world's highest resolution full colour microdisplay. ForthDD employs&#xD;      over 35 staff, many in posts requiring undergraduate and post-graduate&#xD;      qualifications. It has annual revenues in excess of &amp;#163;3M, with exports&#xD;      accounting for 95% of its sales. "A key selling point for Forth&#xD;        Dimension Displays is our ability to produce high quality images in&#xD;        applications where competing technologies do not quite make the grade.&#xD;      Underpinning this image quality are product features enabled by&#xD;        technical specifications such as high pixel aperture ratio and accurate&#xD;        liquid crystal alignment, that were first established through the&#xD;        PHYESTA research on backplane surface quality improvement. The backplane&#xD;        surface quality improvement techniques described by the PHYESTA research&#xD;        have been adopted by CMOS foundries, such as those from which ForthDD&#xD;        obtains the substrates for its current product range."&#xD;      Director of Product Design, ForthDD [F1].&#xD;    The improvements particularly in surface planarity and pixel fill factor&#xD;      achieved by PHYESTA researchers were critical enablers in FLCoS&#xD;      microdisplay technology, allowing them to exceed the threshold of image&#xD;      quality necessary to satisfy customers. The underlying manufacturing&#xD;      processes were made available to ForthDD's commercial CMOS foundry&#xD;      supplier, through publication and direct transfer, and thus were&#xD;      incorporated into product manufacture. The CMOS foundry has continued to&#xD;      refine these. Thus the manufacturability, image quality and optical&#xD;      efficiency of the current product range and the newly released product&#xD;      range rely upon PHYESTA's underlying research into manufacturing&#xD;      techniques. Improvements in active device surface planarity and pixel&#xD;      filling factors achieved by PHYESTA and collaborators were key&#xD;      translational steps. With the exception of the liquid crystal materials&#xD;      themselves and aspects of the drive circuitry, the entire ForthDD product&#xD;      line is substantially and directly underpinned by PHYESTA innovations in&#xD;      optical sciences and materials processing. The collaboration with ForthDD&#xD;      remains active with Hossack and other staff continuing to consult and work&#xD;      with them.&#xD;    PHYESTA/ERPE research [R6], was quickly incorporated into early products&#xD;      and has been continually developed and refined within the company to&#xD;      encompass higher colour depth, higher frame rates and higher definition. "Thus
        every Forth Dimension Displays product, including the most recent&#xD;        product range, the QXGA (2048 x 1536 pixel) microdisplay launched in&#xD;        October 2012, has used and continues to use pulsed RGB LED illumination&#xD;        based upon the original ERPE scheme that was published [R2, R3] as an&#xD;        outcome of the foundational ERPE research." CEO of ForthDD [F2].&#xD;    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;    Impact: Economic gains&#xD;    PHYESTA research has led to the setting up of a company now known as&#xD;      ForthDD. Since 2008 it has increased its annual revenue by more than 25%&#xD;      to around US $5M, and its global workforce from 25 to 35. It has released&#xD;      new products directly underpinned by PHYESTA research as recently as&#xD;      October 2012.&#xD;     &#xD;    &#xD;    Significance:&#xD;    A consortium involving PHYESTA staff in collaboration with Edinburgh's&#xD;      School of Engineering and five industrial partners realised the world's&#xD;      first high-resolution ferroelectric liquid crystal over silicon (FLCOS)&#xD;      microdisplay. This digital display attracted investment from the UK,&#xD;      Taiwan, and USA of over $40m, and was taken forward to production by&#xD;      MicroPix, MicroVue, and Forth Dimension Displays.&#xD;    Reach:&#xD;    ForthDD now has offices in Valencia, USA, and Berlin, Germany.

The Group operated under the direction of Professor David&#xD;      Vass (PHYESTA), who was working on liquid crystal over silicon (LCOS)&#xD;      devices with initial interest in their use for optical correlators, beam&#xD;      steerers, and beam shapers. The ferroelectric class of liquid crystals&#xD;      offered response times an order of magnitude faster than nematic crystals,&#xD;      and could be operated in a binary mode suited to driving digital&#xD;      applications. However, ferroelectric liquid crystal devices posed severe&#xD;      design and manufacturing challenges, as the thickness of the required cell&#xD;      was much thinner than conventional nematic liquid crystal based devices.&#xD;      Typically a sub-micron thickness is required and flatness, cell&#xD;      parallelism and uniformity are also needed to make these devices viable.&#xD;      At first commercial manufacturers of silicon wafers regarded such tight&#xD;      tolerances as unattainable using conventional processing and polishing&#xD;      methods. Vass, Hossack (PHYESTA) and collaborators in the School of&#xD;      Engineering developed designs, pulsed illumination methods, polishing&#xD;      techniques and silicon planarization (removal of excess curvature that can&#xD;      reduce optical coherence and lead to colour artefacts), which produced&#xD;      cells of excellent flatness and high reflectivity sufficient for coherent&#xD;      optical applications [R1, R2]. This work was undertaken with a SERC SCIOS&#xD;      rolling grant, SERC/DTI Link grant SASLM and EU ESPRIT grant HICPOBS over&#xD;      the period 1993-1995 for which Vass was Principal Investigator.&#xD;    Further refinements in the device design led to the realisation of smart&#xD;      pixel structures including light blocking layers and robust backplane&#xD;      electronics enabling a fast digital FLCOS Spatial Light Modulator [R3],&#xD;      which was able to operate under intense illumination. This led to&#xD;      applications in routers for telecoms, holographic projectors, and optical&#xD;      tweezers. The smart algorithms, binary phase holograms, and fast device&#xD;      operation were critical in realising real time full speed operation in&#xD;      these application areas. The realisation of the FLCOS based holographic&#xD;      optical tweezers, permitted for the first time multiple trapping and&#xD;      real-time capture of freely moving microbes, as described in a well cited&#xD;      paper [R4].&#xD;    While more generally applicable these advances directly addressed&#xD;      requirements of the emerging technology of microdisplays, which demanded&#xD;      improved manufacturing methods to enhance image quality and colour&#xD;      fidelity above threshold levels for a practical display. To the basic&#xD;      spatial light modulator device we added fast image processing algorithms&#xD;      in collaboration with GEC, STC, Admit Design, and Davin Optronics, thereby&#xD;      producing the world's first high resolution, video speed, full colour&#xD;      FLCOS digital microdisplay. This device was first showcased at the 6th&#xD;      International Conference on Ferroelectric Devices hosted by ENST and&#xD;      subsequently published in the leading journal for ferroelectric technology&#xD;      [R5,R6]. This prototype device was a key development bringing together&#xD;      VLSI design, surface planarisation, light blocking layers, fast electronic&#xD;      interface and ferroelectric liquid crystals in a fully operational FLCOS&#xD;      device.

    Ultrafast technology is an applications sector that is based in part on
      the laser sources developed by the Ultrafast Lasers Group (ULG) as
      described in section 2. The use of this technology underlies a wide range
      of applications that have emerged since the 1990s and have developed
      rapidly throughout the period of assessment (2008 - 2013.) These range
      from the development of ultraprecise measurements of frequency required
      for internet communications to the latest generation of techniques for
      corrective eye surgery. The importance of the work of the ULG is
      highlighted by the CEO of Femtolasers who states "...the work of
        Professor Sibbett and more recently Dr Brown and Professor Sibbett has
        played a major role in leading the development and applications of
        ultrafast laser technology..." [F1].
    The development of practical technologies to achieve mode-locked laser
      operation was the underpinning requirement for the global development of
      ultrafast technology in the 1990s and its subsequent adaptation into a
      widely adopted technology from the early 2000s to the present day. Work in
      the field by the ULG was of major influence in defining product
      technologies for major multinational companies in the field including
      Coherent and Spectra Physics (now part of Newport) in the USA. This
      adoption led directly to the development of a suite of commercial devices
      (Coherent MIRA and Spectra Physics Tsunami) that continue to underpin the
      commercial sector. The scale of the success of these technologies can be
      estimated by the fact that "...there are many thousands of Titanium
        Sapphire Kerr lens mode-locked lasers installed worldwide..." [F2] A
      conservative estimate of $100k per system in 2013 shows that this market
      alone is worth many $100s million. The more recent work described above
      continues to have a major influence on the decision making processes of
      these leading international companies as the Advanced R&amp;amp;D Manager for
      Spectra-Physics states "...the work of your St Andrews research group
        ... has continued to be of interest and influence within the commercial
        laser community." [F3]
    In addition to product development by major commercial players, the
      research highlighted above also has led to the development of laser
      systems by the smaller specialist laser companies such as M Squared in the
      UK, FemtoLasers, a multi-million &amp;#8364; turnover SME in Austria [F1] and KML
      Inc in the USA with new product launches occurring throughout 2008 - 2013.
      Continuing through the period 2008 - 2013, new commercial laser systems,
      amplifiers and applications such as multi-photon microscopes have begun
      to further revolutionise fields as diverse as biology, medicine and
      manufacturing technology. Indeed, the source technology has now reached
      such a point of maturity that it is now routinely installed as OEM
      components within products such as systems for eye surgery [S1].
    The impact of the research can also be identified through its influence
      on a range of applications that impinge on many areas of society. [text
      removed for publication]. A major recent development has been the
      deployment of ultrafast lasers within medical treatments, particularly for
      surgery on the eye. For example, the IntraLase system now offers
      commercial refractive surgery to more than five million of patients
      worldwide and the latest generation of treatment for cataracts is based on
      the use of ultrafast laser systems related to those developed by Sibbett.
      [S2]
    The measurement and characterisation of ultrafast pulses remains an area
      of key importance within this technology field. The ULG showed that a
      highly simplified method based on non-linear absorption in low cost
      semiconductor devices could be used to obtain basic pulse duration
      information. This innovation was patent protected (US6195167 B1 - granted
      2001) and subsequently licensed by Elliot Scientific to produce an award
      winning commercial product, the Timewarp Autocorrelator. [S3]
    A major impact of the work of the Sibbett group has been one of
      influence. A study in 2010 of emerging ultrahigh intensity laser
      facilities shows that there was more than $4.5 Bn of activities under
      development between then and 2015 and more than half of these are based on
      technology directly developed within PHYESTA [S4]. Notably, many major
      companies and individuals have highlighted the importance of the work in
      the 1 f06dm and 2 f06dm spectral regions from 2000 onwards and in
      diode-pumped femtosecond lasers to product development [F1, F3-5]. [text
      removed for publication].
    A 2008 survey showed that the ultrafast laser market was worth
      approximately $260M annually with a predicted year-on-year growth of up to
      30% [S4]. Many of the developments in this field have been influenced and
      underpinned by the work of the Sibbett Group that retains a place of major
      world influence within the field both through its historic and on-going
      research. [F1-5]

    Ultrashort-pulsed lasers as the underpinning technology for ultrafast
        technology.

    A large number of longitudinal resonator modes can reach threshold in
      broadband lasers and a choice can be made to impose an operational status
      that `persuades' all of these lasing modes to oscillate together in phase
      &amp;#8212; in a so-called phase-locked or mode-locked operation.
      The Ultrafast Lasers Group have been long-established pioneers in this
      field and have produced a range of laser sources that offer significant
      advantages over competing approaches. Within this period of assessment,
      work within PHYESTA has helped to improve the operational parameters of
      the most commonly deployed femtosecond Ti-sapphire lasers to achieve pulse
      durations as short as 5 femtoseconds and average powers of watts and peak
      powers up to megawatts[R1].
    The Ti:Sapphire crystal gain medium, whilst remaining perhaps the key
      technology for solid-state ultrashort pulse lasers, suffers some major
      disadvantages, including the requirement for high-power pump lasers in
      the difficult-to-access green part of the spectrum reducing efficiency and
      driving up costs. To this end, work was undertaken by the Ultrafast Lasers
      Group in the mid-to late 1990s and 2000s on a range of other gain
      materials that demonstrated the potential for direct diode pumped
      femtosecond lasers in the near-infrared part of the spectrum (800 nm &amp;#8212;
      1100 nm) [R2-R4] opening up the potential for new products and application
      from sources that have the potential for much lower cost and higher
      operating efficiencies. A major drive in this period was also the
      development of advanced laser cavity designs that permitted the
      development of very compact ultrafast lasers that still offer attractive
      output performance levels [R3]. The research has continued and in the
      2010s research and development relating to new spectral areas, including
      the important 2 f06dm region, offer exciting potential for an enlarged
      array of applications in surgery, communications and metrology [R5].
    In addition to the development of new laser sources, the group also
      demonstrated in 1997 a range of original and innovative measurement
      techniques providing a step change in the simplicity and practicality of
      the measurement of ultrafast pulses through 2-photon based autocorrelation
      schemes [R6].
    Personnel
    Key PHYESTA researchers involved were Professor Wilson Sibbett (present
      as staff, and then emeritus, throughout period of assessment), Dr Derryck
      Reid (PDRA / EPSRC Advanced Fellow 1994 - 2000), Dr Alexander Lagatsky
      (PDRA 2001 - 2013) and Dr Tom Brown (PDRA 1999 - 2005, Lecturer / Senior
      Lecturer / Reader 2005 - present).

    i1) Informed by historical and practice-led research, Britain's most&#xD;
        iconic literary figure is reinterpreted for a wide public by one of&#xD;
        Britain's most f&amp;#234;ted living poets.&#xD;
    While Shakespeare's plays have continually been interpreted and renewed&#xD;
      for non-specialist audiences through adaptation for film and other media,&#xD;
      the Sonnets represent a major aspect of the Shakespearean canon that, to&#xD;
      date, had not much benefitted from the popular appeal that adaptation into&#xD;
      new media can bring. The singularity of the Sonnets within Shakespeare's&#xD;
      oeuvre then, is partly due to their remoteness to modern audiences&#xD;
      otherwise at ease with Shakespeare. Don Paterson's Reading&#xD;
        Shakespeare's Sonnets, based partly on his practice-led research as&#xD;
      a sonneteer, and informed by Rhodes' research, made a major contribution&#xD;
      to public debate about, and understanding of, Shakespeare's sonnets, as&#xD;
      evidenced in the numerous reviews it generated in the non-academic print&#xD;
      press, and in online media and blogs: `a masterclass for the lay reader'&#xD;
      (The Times); `one of the finest living poets brings to this a&#xD;
        craftsman's insight' (The Independent); `combines highly&#xD;
        sensitive attention to detail... with due awareness of historical&#xD;
        context' (The Financial Times); `deep knowledge shared at&#xD;
        speed' (The Daily Telegraph); `literary criticism was&#xD;
        never so amusing' (Lizzy's Literary Life); `a critical milestone'&#xD;
      (Clive James); a restoration job on a masterpiece' (The Sunday&#xD;
        Herald, which also mentions Rhodes's scholarship as having `done&#xD;
      much' to rid modern academia of its `jargon-ridden lingo'). [S6]&#xD;
    Print sales of Reading Shakespeare's Sonnets stood at just over&#xD;
      8,500 at the end of the census date. [S1] Retailing at &amp;#163;17.99 (Hb) and&#xD;
      &amp;#163;12.99 (Pb), Reading Shakespeare's Sonnets also therefore made a&#xD;
      significant economic contribution to Faber's poetry list (most poetry&#xD;
      titles do not sell more than around 1,500 copies). See (i3) below for its&#xD;
      digital distribution. Paterson further promoted the reach and impact of&#xD;
      the research by conducting a series of high-profile, public-facing talks&#xD;
      on the Sonnets that included: a reading and talk at the Cheltenham Book&#xD;
      Festival 09/10/2010; a discussion at the British Library with Ben Crystal,&#xD;
      Eric Rasmussen and Jonathan Bate, 02/02/2011; a reading at Cambridge&#xD;
      Wordfest 16/04/2011 [S1]; at Hay Book Festival 29/05/2011; a talk, `For&#xD;
      the Love of Shakespeare', at Edinburgh Book Festival 23/08/2011; and at&#xD;
      Durham Book Festival 22/10/2011. The Festival Director of Cambridge&#xD;
      Wordfest reported: `audience feedback was excellent. Don Paterson's&#xD;
        ability to make the complexities of Shakespeare intelligible to a mixed&#xD;
        audience provided a crucial cultural contribution to the festival'.&#xD;
      [S2] Paterson also wrote a general
        article on the Sonnets for The Guardian on 16/10/2010,&#xD;
      generating over 120 comments in which his arguments are debated&#xD;
      passionately by members of the public. [S7]&#xD;
    i2) Literary heritage is presented to a wide audience via a UK-wide&#xD;
        charitable trust dedicated to promoting literature among non-traditional&#xD;
        readers. Public interest in Shakespeare is stimulated.&#xD;
    As a result of the expertise displayed in Reading Shakespeare's&#xD;
        Sonnets, and as a further mark of its impact, Paterson, `as a&#xD;
        renowned expert', was invited by the charitable trust World
        Book Night to be the consultant editor for a selection of 25&#xD;
      Shakespeare Sonnets to coincide with Shakespeare's birthday on 23/04/2012.&#xD;
      [S3] The mission statement of World Book Night (WBN) is `To raise the&#xD;
      profile of reading through a mass engagement project which works at a&#xD;
      grass roots level to inspire those who don02bct regularly read to do so.'&#xD;
      (What We Do).
      As part of WBN's collaboration with Paterson, a total of 2.5 million&#xD;
      copies of 25 different books from authors as diverse as Jane Austen and&#xD;
      Bill Bryson were given away, each with sonnet on the inside back cover, chosen
        by Paterson to complement the title. [S8]&#xD;
    According to the WBN 2012 Evaluation
        Report: almost 2000 libraries and over 500 bookshops participated;&#xD;
      with the support of a valuable BBC partnership more than a million people&#xD;
      visited the WBN website and millions more were reached via social media.&#xD;
      [S9] Of the 2.5 million books distributed, 625,000 were given away by&#xD;
      individual volunteers, the rest in association with third-party&#xD;
      organisations. The Chief Executive of World Book Night reported that as a&#xD;
      result of Paterson's involvement `we were able to ensure a Shakespeare&#xD;
        poem reached 625,000 people who don't regularly read'. [S3] 54% of&#xD;
      WBN's volunteer givers distributed some of their books to youth; 30% to&#xD;
      adult learners; 18% to hospital/care staff; 13% to patients; 8% to prison&#xD;
      inmates. In addition to books distributed by volunteer givers, WBN&#xD;
      committed a further 520,000 copies directly to engage with the hardest to&#xD;
      reach givers in prisons, hospitals, care homes, social, sheltered, and&#xD;
      supported housing and through a range of charitable partners. Working with&#xD;
      partner organisations 111 prisons and young offender institutes (75% of UK&#xD;
      prisons) received more than 40,000 books. [S9] As a result of this mass&#xD;
      distribution of a variety of both classic and contemporary literary&#xD;
      titles, new and diverse audiences were also found for Shakespeare's&#xD;
      Sonnets. It is worth noting that according to Google, the highest spike in&#xD;
      internet searches for `Shakespeare's Sonnets' since February 2010 occurred&#xD;
      in April 2012 (and more than is usually the case around Shakespeare's&#xD;
      birthday). [S10] While correlation does not always indicate cause, it&#xD;
      seems plausible that Paterson's activities with WBN prompted public&#xD;
      interest in searches to do with Shakespeare's Sonnets.&#xD;
    As a result of this initiative, Paterson was invited onto Radio
        4's Front Row (monthly download figures of over 230,000 in addition&#xD;
      to Radio 4's live audience of c. 849,000 listeners weekly) on 23/04/2012&#xD;
      (at 19.59 minutes) to discuss the Sonnets and his selection for World Book&#xD;
      Night, further stimulating public awareness and understanding of them.&#xD;
      Paterson also appeared in The
          Guardian (print circulation c. 200,000) on 20/04/2012,&#xD;
      discussing his project in advance of WBN.&#xD;
    i3) Innovation and entrepreneurial activity is supported by&#xD;
        contribution to development of a new product in the digital publishing&#xD;
        industry. Simultaneously, contribution is made to the economic&#xD;
        prosperity of that industry, and Shakespeare is reinterpreted for new&#xD;
        audiences.&#xD;
    Paterson's work in Reading Shakespeare's Sonnets also directly&#xD;
      led to his being invited to work as principal consultant and contributor&#xD;
      to Faber/Touch Press's Shakespeare's Sonnets iPad App, launched in April&#xD;
      2012. This App features a lightly re-written version of all of Paterson's&#xD;
      commentary, as well as him reading several sonnets. In this way Paterson&#xD;
      was instrumental in translating four hundred year-old poetry from the age&#xD;
      of print into a new digital medium, helping to create an innovative new&#xD;
      software product and to consolidate the entrepreneurial activity of a&#xD;
      relatively new start-up business at the same time. (Touch Press had only&#xD;
      released one App before Shakespeare's Sonnets.)&#xD;
    According to the Head of Faber Digital the development budget of the App&#xD;
      was [text removed for publication] and Paterson's role as `literary&#xD;
      advisor' was integral to that development process: `Don was central to&#xD;
        the creation of an app that is at once academically rigorous and&#xD;
        immediately appealing to a wide and general audience. Many of the&#xD;
        reviews of the app specifically recognise the value of Don's&#xD;
        contribution.' [S4] Faber's digital project manager also&#xD;
      acknowledged in The Independent that Paterson's commentary was&#xD;
      central to the App's successful design: `the notes matter as much as&#xD;
        the stellar reciters... We've given them a lot of love and attention.&#xD;
        They really do behave in a joined up way.' [S11] The Sonnets App&#xD;
      retails at &amp;#163;9.99 and according to the Senior Producer and Editor at Touch&#xD;
      Press, was downloaded [text removed for publication] times in the period&#xD;
      to 31 July 2013. [S5] Fifteen months after the App's launch, therefore,&#xD;
      Touch Press had not only recovered their development costs, but generated&#xD;
      a revenue of over &amp;#163;20,000: a significant sum for a small and relatively&#xD;
      young independent business. That `[text removed for publication] of&#xD;
        these downloads were specifically via the Education Volume Discount&#xD;
        program' [S5], further indicates that the App is beginning to have&#xD;
      some educational application.&#xD;
    This new digital version of the Sonnets also prompted media and&#xD;
      blogosphere discussion of the Sonnets: it was positively reviewed as `magnificent'&#xD;
      by U.S. current affairs site Salon&#xD;
      on 24/07/2012 [S12]; tweeted by David
        Tennant on 28/06/2012; mentioned with reference to Paterson's&#xD;
      commentary on BBC One's Andrew
        Marr Show on 08/07/2012 as evidence of the `relevance of Shakespeare&#xD;
      to the 21st Century'; reviewed in The
          Guardian on 08/07/2012 (`Paterson's commentary is the best&#xD;
        thing about this app'); reviewed in The
          Independent on 17/07/2012 (`a digital delight') [S11];&#xD;
      and shortlisted for the FutureBook Innovation Awards. [S4]&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    While Shakespeare's plays enjoy a strong presence in popular culture&#xD;
      (including through film adaptations), the Sonnets have remained relatively&#xD;
      less accessible. Practice-led research in the School, conducted by Don&#xD;
      Paterson, twice winner of the T. S. Eliot prize for poetry, and informed&#xD;
      partly by the historical research of Renaissance colleague Neil Rhodes led&#xD;
      to Paterson's Reading Shakespeare's Sonnets, a full-length popular&#xD;
      commentary written from the perspective of a practising sonneteer.&#xD;
      Subsequently Paterson's research benefitted World Book Night 2012 and&#xD;
      involved him in work as consultant and contributor for Faber/Touch Press&#xD;
      on their highly successful Shakespeare's Sonnets iPad application. The&#xD;
      impact of this research has been that (1) an historically remote and&#xD;
      formally challenging body of poetic work has been reinterpreted for a wide&#xD;
      non-academic audience; (2) contribution has been made to innovative,&#xD;
      entrepreneurial activity in the digital publishing sector, while cultural&#xD;
      heritage has simultaneously been `curated'; (3) economic prosperity in the&#xD;
      publishing and software industries has been stimulated. The users of&#xD;
      research in this case study are the reading public; a major charitable&#xD;
      trust; a relatively new digital publishing company; the print publishing&#xD;
      industry.&#xD;

    Since his appointment in the School of English at St Andrews in 2002, Don&#xD;
      Paterson has been exploring the sonnet form, both in his own compositions&#xD;
      (in the poetry volumes Landing Light and Rain) and through&#xD;
      translation of Rilke's sonnets into English sonnet form (Orpheus: After&#xD;
        Rilke's Sonnette an Orpheus). [R1; R3; R4] These publications,&#xD;
      therefore, present the fruits of practice-based research into the form of&#xD;
      the sonnet and what can be done with and through that form in the English&#xD;
      language.&#xD;
    In line with the School's policy of pairing newly appointed Creative&#xD;
      Writing colleagues with academic mentors, Neil Rhodes, a Renaissance&#xD;
      researcher in post throughout the assessment period, was assigned as&#xD;
      Paterson's mentor in 2002. Rhodes was then carrying out extensive research&#xD;
      into Shakespeare's use of form, including that of the sonnet. In the year&#xD;
      immediately preceding Paterson's arrival, Rhodes had organized a public&#xD;
      event at the St Andrews Scottish Writing Centre called `Did Shakespeare&#xD;
      Study Creative Writing?'. It was therefore natural that Rhodes and&#xD;
      Paterson discussed their shared research interests in poetic form, and the&#xD;
      sonnet in particular. Rhodes's work on the Elizabethan ars poetica&#xD;
      traces the development of a distinctive English poetic voice in the&#xD;
      closing years of the sixteenth century by focusing on structure&#xD;
      (`framing') and sound (`tuning'). It addresses the controversy over&#xD;
      `rhyme' in its double sense of accentual syllabic verse and what Puttenham&#xD;
      calls `tuneable conceits' and shows how critics such as Daniel argued for&#xD;
      a natural alliance between structure and sound in the English iambic&#xD;
      pentameter in the period that Shakespeare was composing his Sonnets.&#xD;
      Rhodes would later publish his research in his 2004 Oxford University&#xD;
      Press monograph Shakespeare and the Origins of English (the second&#xD;
      chapter of which is called `Did Shakespeare study creative writing?') and&#xD;
      his book chapter `Framing and Tuning in Renaissance English Verse'. [R2&#xD;
      &amp;amp; R5]&#xD;
    During the course of this dialogue between poet and Renaissance&#xD;
      specialist, it became clear that room existed for a new, full-length&#xD;
      commentary on Shakespeare's sonnets, written from the perspective of a&#xD;
      practising poet who well understands the constraints and opportunities of&#xD;
      the sonnet form, but without the sacrifice of historical perspective. The&#xD;
      result of these conversations was Paterson's book Reading&#xD;
        Shakespeare's Sonnets (2010), a book aimed not exclusively at&#xD;
      academics, but also at poetry readers in general. [R6] Reading&#xD;
        Shakespeare's Sonnets then, occupies a double position in this case&#xD;
      study, being both a practice-led research output (a full-length study&#xD;
      from the perspective of one of the foremost living sonneteers in English),&#xD;
      and also a vehicle for impact itself (interpreting Shakespeare's sonnets&#xD;
      for a non-specialist audience), arising from the fruit of previous&#xD;

    The laser systems developed have largely resulted in an economic impact&#xD;
      based on licensing and sales of the products developed by two of the key&#xD;
      partners in the research grants mentioned above. These companies are a&#xD;
      German diode laser company, Innolume and a UK based laser manufacturer, M&#xD;
      Squared Lasers. This extremely fruitful partnership of the Dundee Group&#xD;
      with these manufacturers has led to a successful economic impact for both&#xD;
      companies and the University over a very short period of time.&#xD;
    Innolume have significantly improved the performance of one of their key&#xD;
      products called the "Gain Chip" thanks to the work carried out with the&#xD;
      Dundee Group. The company estimate that this improved device has led to&#xD;
      approximately &amp;#8364;100k in annual income [REFa]. The gain chips are used by&#xD;
      end users in a variety of applications from tuneable lasers [5], narrow&#xD;
      linewidth external cavity diode lasers and in emerging applications using&#xD;
      swept laser sources such as optical coherence tomography.&#xD;
    Additionally the quantum dot research has led to a range of new Innolume&#xD;
      products being developed and the initial income is now starting to build&#xD;
      despite the fact that the research on these topics has largely been&#xD;
      carried out over the period 2008-2012. Innolume's current revenues&#xD;
      (2009-2013) from this research are: &amp;#8364;20k from novel ultra short pulse&#xD;
      laser sources; &amp;#8364;25k from QD THz antennas designs and &amp;#8364;10k from novel&#xD;
      Semiconductor Saturable Absorber Mirror (SESAMs) designs [REFa].&#xD;
    The work with M Squared Lasers has also led to new products being brought&#xD;
      to market [text removed for publication] [REFb]. This work was based on&#xD;
      the research that was developed in the FASTDOT project.&#xD;
    The two patents mentioned in the references section [P1 and P2] have&#xD;
      underpinned the second relationship of the Dundee group, this time with M&#xD;
      Squared Lasers. M Squared Lasers have licensed both patents and are&#xD;
      developing these into new product lines. They have developed a QD laser&#xD;
      from the patent [P1] &amp;#8212; the applications ultimately being for end users&#xD;
      looking for compact sources in areas such as photodynamic therapy, and&#xD;
      evolving into multiphoton imaging and microscopy (which has been&#xD;
      demonstrated as viable by the Rafailov group, and patented along with&#xD;
      authors from M Squared Lasers). The income to date (since 2009 when the&#xD;
      license was taken up) is &amp;#163;10k [REFc].&#xD;
    The second license was based around the patent [P2] to be used to develop&#xD;
      a new laser source based around the conical refraction effect. This has&#xD;
      resulted in &amp;#163;16k of income [REFb] since the patent was licensed in 2009,&#xD;
      with further development being funded through a &amp;#163;195k KTP award&#xD;
      (2011-2014) with the company, demonstrating the early impact of this&#xD;
      particular strand of work on highly efficient solid state laser sources.&#xD;
      The relationship between Dundee and M Squared Lasers is significant; this&#xD;
      has been underpinned with two other KTP projects in the last five years,&#xD;
      to work on compact laser sources for near-infrared imaging (KTP 7071) and&#xD;
      THz sources for imaging applications (KTP 7892). The value of this&#xD;
      commercial interaction is substantial. It is the 9th highest&#xD;
      supplier of industry income to the University, lying only behind eight&#xD;
      large pharmaceutical companies. Income in the REF period is &amp;#163;363k, with&#xD;
      &amp;#163;262k of this being in financial year 2012-13.&#xD;
	  &#xD;
	  Figure 2: Toptica prototype based on work at Dundee&#xD;
	  &#xD;
    The interaction between the research at Dundee and M Squared Lasers has&#xD;
      led to the growth of the company and they have employed two extra staff to&#xD;
      help further develop products as a direct result of this work. The company&#xD;
      is a SME with around 40 employees, so these hires are 5% of the total&#xD;
      workforce.&#xD;
    Additionally Toptica (GmbH), another German laser company, has developed&#xD;
      a prototype (figure 2) tuneable QD laser source based on the outcomes of&#xD;
      the research conducted at the University of Dundee, but as yet no device&#xD;
      has been brought to market based on these research outcomes [REFd].&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    This is an example of early economic impact where research on various&#xD;
      aspects of laser engineering has resulted in the development of&#xD;
      inexpensive, compact, efficient and user-friendly laser sources. An&#xD;
      example is the incorporation of quantum dot structures into semiconductor&#xD;
      laser architectures, with these replacing much larger and more expensive&#xD;
      systems, with a range of applications in areas such as microscopy,&#xD;
      biomedical diagnosis and therapy. This work has led to the generation of&#xD;
      key know-how and patents that have been subsequently licensed as well as&#xD;
      resulting in a variety of laser-related products being brought to market.&#xD;
      Additionally, it has resulted in extra staff being employed at one of our&#xD;
      partner companies.&#xD;

    Since 1987, Professor Edik Rafailov has been engaged in the research and&#xD;
      development of novel semiconductor lasers, nonlinear and integrated&#xD;
      optics. On moving to Dundee in 2005 his group began to get involved with a&#xD;
      number of new projects developing novel laser architectures and&#xD;
      laser-based optical tools. Much of this research was carried out with&#xD;
      industrial partners and these collaborations have led to a number of new&#xD;
      devices being brought to market. This work has primarily been in the area&#xD;
      of compact and efficient laser systems and their applications, underpinned&#xD;
      by funding from a number of sources, especially the EU FP7, EPSRC and KTP&#xD;
      funding (some representative grants are shown in section 3).&#xD;
    One of the major directions has been on cw and ultrafast semiconductor&#xD;
      quantum-dot-based lasers, funded through a &amp;#8364;13.7M grant called FASTDOT.&#xD;
    Ultrafast lasers are able to generate light pulses with durations&#xD;
      spanning from a few femtoseconds (fs) to a few picoseconds, with&#xD;
      applications in areas such as non-invasive diagnostics and therapeutic&#xD;
      medicine, micromachining, spectroscopy and imaging (1fs to 1s is the same&#xD;
      as 1s to 32 million years). The currently available ultrafast lasers are&#xD;
      bulky, expensive, difficult to operate and often offer limited flexibility&#xD;
      in how their pulse characteristics can be matched to a specific&#xD;
      application. The Photonics and Nanoscience Group at the University of&#xD;
      Dundee has undertaken a very significant programme of research in&#xD;
      conjunction with many companies (in particular with Innolume GmbH, and M&#xD;
      Squared Lasers) to manufacture and develop low-cost, compact and turn-key&#xD;
      laser sources that can generate ultrashort optical pulses with tailored&#xD;
      characteristics. Such operational characteristics are particularly&#xD;
      critical in the development of novel optical tools for diagnostics and&#xD;
      therapy in the biomedical sciences.&#xD;
	  &#xD;
	  Figure 1 Compact laser system of the type developed in this case study&#xD;
	  &#xD;
    In order to achieve these goals, the Dundee group has focused on a novel&#xD;
      class of materials &amp;#8212; semiconductor quantum dots (QDs).&#xD;
    QDs consist of tiny clusters of semiconductor material with dimensions of&#xD;
      only a few nanometers. The unique properties of these materials enable the&#xD;
      manufacture of compact, efficient and environmentally stable semiconductor&#xD;
      lasers.&#xD;
    This work produced a range of new mode-locked and cw laser sources based&#xD;
      around quantum dot technology [1-3], which have enabled a number of&#xD;
      applications in biomedical imaging and therapy, resulting in a patent on&#xD;
      the use of a quantum-dot-based laser for photodynamic therapy [P1]. This&#xD;
      then led to a number of spin off projects, such as the development of&#xD;
      terahertz emitters [4] and devices producing widely tuneable visible light&#xD;
      [5].&#xD;
    Another major research vector on the development of compact and efficient&#xD;
      lasers has been the investigation of an old optical phenomena called&#xD;
      `conical refraction' in which light passing through a biaxial crystal&#xD;
      leads to an output beam with an unusual cone shaped intensity profile and&#xD;
      polarisation properties. This was used to make an incredibly efficient&#xD;
      (close to 99% of the theoretical efficiency) laser [6]. This work led to a&#xD;
      patent [P2], and subsequent KTP funding in collaboration with M Squared&#xD;
      Lasers to further develop the concept to a marketable device.&#xD;
    The work on quantum dot lasers and the collaboration with M Squared&#xD;
      Lasers has also led to the filing of a third patent, which is focused on&#xD;
      the development of novel laser systems based on semiconductor disk and&#xD;
      quantum dot lasers for nonlinear optical microscopy of biological&#xD;
      organisms. The patent is shared between members of the FASTDOT consortium,&#xD;
      including M Squared Lasers.&#xD;

    The beneficiaries:
    (a) The Pharmaceutical industry (particularly GlaxoSmithKline, Aeterna
      Zenartis and Merck &amp;amp; Co who benefited from the evidence that targeting
      PKB should be efficacious and from structural evidence for the
      druggability of PKB).
    (b) Cancer patients (those who have already benefited in Phase II
      clinical trials and those likely to benefit from future drug combinations)
    (c) Life sciences companies (through the production and sales of reagents
      used to probe the PKB/Akt signaling pathway in normal and diseased
      tissue).
    Impacts:
    Drug development of PKB/Akt inhibitors for the treatment of cancer
    Dissection of the PKB signalling pathway and elucidation of the PKB
      crystal structure has been extremely influential, stimulating
      pharmaceutical companies to develop specific inhibitors of this pathway
      for therapy. PKB/Akt is associated with tumor cell survival,
      proliferation, and invasiveness. Activation of PKB/Akt is one of the most
      frequent alterations observed in human cancer, making PKB/Akt an
      attractive target for cancer therapy. The MRC non-exclusively licensed the
      IP from the PKB inhibitor screening methods patent (EP 0862622 B1) to a
      major pharmaceutical company (name withheld for confidentiality reasons)
      who has used the IP in their drug discovery efforts resulting in clinical
      phase development. As part of this agreement, the MRC received a total of
      &amp;#163;150,000 (1).
    A number of companies have initiated drug development campaigns in this
      area and several novel agents have been advanced into clinical trials
      including the three examples below:
    GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
    In 2008, GSK developed GSK690693, a low-nanomolar pan-PKB kinase
      inhibitor (2). GSK690693 exhibited significant antitumor activity in
      ovarian, prostate and breast carcinoma xenograft models (3). Consequently,
      GSK690693 entered Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of hematologic
      malignancies. However, clinical development was suspended, perhaps due to
      potential side effects subsequently reported by GSK in rodents. GSK have
      since developed further PKB/Akt inhibitors that have now entered clinical
      trials. Currently 1 Phase II and 2 Phase 1 trials are underway testing the
      efficacy of the orally available ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK2110183 in
      multiple myeloma, haematologic malignancies and solid tumours (4) and 3
      Phase I trials of the ATP-competitive inhibitor GSK2141795 are underway
      for the treatment of solid tumours, ovarian cancer and lymphoma (5).
      Promising results for GSK2141795 have been reported in gynecological, head
      and neck, prostrate, and colon cancers (6).
    Aeterna Zentaris
    Structural biology studies by Prof Daan Van Aalten at the University of
      Dundee showed that lipid binding to the PH domain activates PKB/Akt, thus
      revealing an alternative mechanism of PKB/Akt inhibition. Perifosine, an
      oral PKB/Akt inhibitor, was developed by Aeterna Zentaris using this
      strategy and this compound has been through 19 Phase I and 25 Phase II
      clinical trials and entered Phase 3 clinical trials for colon cancer and
      multiple myeloma in 2010 and 2009 respectively (7) (http://clinicaltrials.gov).
      While the Perifosine Phase 3 trials were not successful, the impact of the
      fundamental research on this drug development strategy was very
      significant.
    Merck &amp;amp; Co
    MK-2206 is an oral, non-ATP competitive allosteric PKB/Akt inhibitor with
      potential antineoplastic activity developed by Merck. There are currently
      41 active or completed clinical trials testing the efficacy of this drug
      in a variety of cancers (http://clinicaltrials.gov).
      In 2009, Merck announced a partnership with AstraZeneca to develop a
      combination anti-cancer regimen composed of MK- 2206 from Merck together
      with a mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 inhibitor AZD6244 from
      AstraZeneca (8).
    Development of reagents by life science companies
    The identification by the University of Dundee that phosphorylation of
      PKB/Akt at Thr308 and Ser473 is required for full activation of the kinase
      has led to the development of many new reagents by life science companies.
      The University of Dundee entered into an exclusive arrangement with Merck
      Millipore (formerly Upstate Biotechnology) to sell PKB reagents developed
      and produced by the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit and the Division of
      Signal Transduction Therapy. Subsequently, Merck Millipore designed a
      number of PKB-related catalogue items such as antibodies, assay kits, and
      fluorescently labelled proteins. Since 2008, total sales of PKB related
      products by Merck Millipore for which the University of Dundee has
      received royalties has amounted to $1,784,449 (9).
    Phospho-specific antibodies specific to Thr308 and Ser473 residues to
      measure the activation of PKB/Akt are now sold by many life science
      companies including Cell Signaling Technology (http://www.cellsignal.com)
      (who currently sell 23 different phospho-specific antibodies to these
      sites, Invitrogen (http://www.invitrogen.com),
      Santa Cruz Biotech (www.scbt.com), BD
      Biosciences (www.bdbiosciences.com)
      and Sigma Aldrich (www.sigmaaldrich.com).
      Many of these companies also sell assay kits for detecting downstream
      physiological substrates of activated PKB such as GSK-3, identified as a
      target of PKB/Akt activity by the University of Dundee.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The protein kinase PKB (also known as Akt) is a key regulator of cell
      proliferation and survival that is commonly dysregulated in human cancers.
      Work at the University of Dundee in the late 1990s identified key
      components of this signaling pathway and established the mechanism by
      which PKB becomes activated through phosphorylation. Structural studies at
      the University provided important insights for the design of small
      molecules permitting targeted inhibition of this enzyme. PKB is a firmly
      established focus for pharmacological intervention and several clinical
      trials are underway testing the antineoplastic activity of PKB inhibitors
      in a variety of cancers.

    Uncovering the PKB signalling cascade and the development of PKB
      inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Biological Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    Intracellular signaling through a cascade involving the phosphoinositide
      3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Protein kinase B (PKB) is a major regulator of
      metabolism, cell growth, cell-cycle progression, cell survival,
      transcription and motility. PKB was first identified in 1991 by its
      homology to protein kinase A, protein kinase C and the retroviral
      oncogene, viral Akt. Interest was stimulated in the cancer field by the
      finding that PKB was overexpressed in a significant percentage of ovarian,
      pancreatic and breast cancers. In 1995, it was shown that PKB acted
      downstream of the PI 3- kinase, which generates
      phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), an inositol
      phospholipid that is a key signalling intermediate. Six months later, a
      collaboration between the laboratory of Sir Philip Cohen FRS
      (Director of the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit in Dundee from 1990 to
      2012) and Brian Hemmings (Friedrich Miescher Institute) identified
      glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as the first physiological substrate for
      PKB (1). This publication was highly influential and is the third most
      highly cited basic research paper in the PKB field. Shortly thereafter, Prof
        Dario Alessi FRS (a postdoctoral fellow then Programme Leader at the
      MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit) demonstrated that PKB interacts with PIP3
      with submicromolar affinity (2). A further paper in 1996 by Alessi
      demonstrated that phosphorylation of PKB at two key sites (Thr308 and
      Ser473) was required for its maximal activation (3). This work suggested
      that PKB was activated by an unidentified upstream kinase and in 1997
      Alessi reported in a seminal paper the purification and identification of
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, PDK1, which activates PKB
      by phosphorylation on Thr308 in the presence of PIP3 (4). A
      subsequent paper by Alessi in 1998 revealed that binding of the inositol
      phospholipids to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PKB was necessary
      for PDK1 to phosphorylate and activate PKB (5).
    Further insight into the mechanism of PKB activation resulted from
      determination of the PKB crystal structure by Prof Daan Van Aalten
        FRSE (Principal Investigator at the College of Life Sciences) (6 and
      subsequent papers). These studies have aided small molecule targeting of
      the enzyme by suggesting binding sites where small molecule inhibition
      should be possible; for example by inhibiting ATP or substrate binding to
      the kinase domain, or disrupting inositol lipid binding to the PH domain.
    A patent (EP 0862622 B1) on methods for screening for PKB inhibitors was
      subsequently granted, citing the authors of the original GSK3 paper as
      co-inventors (1). The MRC and Novartis entered into an agreement to
      jointly exploit the IP in 2004.
    These fundamental contributions that influenced multiple industrial drug
      discovery campaigns and led to several current clinical trials, were
      transmitted to members of the pharmaceutical industry prior to publication
      through the University of Dundee's unique Division of Transduction Therapy
      (DSTT) pre-competitive research consortium (as well as to the entire
      pharmaceutical industry following publication) &amp;#8212; see Impact case study
      entitled "The impact of kinase profiling research at the University of
      Dundee on identifying areas of biology rich drug targets and accelerating
      product development in the pharmaceutical industry."

    The underpinning research described above has had an impact both on&#xD;
      indoor monitoring of microclimates in museums and on damage assessment of&#xD;
      cultural heritage materials. It has succeeded in raising awareness to&#xD;
      risks of damage to objects on display in showcases and in enclosures&#xD;
      during storage or in transit. The dosimeter that we have developed is a&#xD;
      small portable tool with a fast response time that is practical for use in&#xD;
      museums and galleries. The dosimeter is easy for conservators to use in&#xD;
      order to evaluate whether inappropriate materials have been used in&#xD;
      showcases and as backboards for paintings, and the effect of different air&#xD;
      exchange rates.&#xD;
    Use of dosimeters in museums&#xD;
    Throughout our research programme, we have worked with the Tate Gallery&#xD;
      to develop and test our devices so that they are useful and relevant to&#xD;
      professional conservators. The Tate now uses our dosimeters to monitor&#xD;
      levels of air pollution in its store rooms and identify effects on&#xD;
      paintings and sculptures. The Conservation Department at the Tate report&#xD;
      that: "The Piezoelectric quartz crystal dosimeter PQC has provided a&#xD;
        means of gaining a much better idea of the extent of air pollution in&#xD;
        store rooms and, more importantly, identifying its effect on the&#xD;
        collection of paintings and sculpture...We can now start putting into&#xD;
        practice new routines, where necessary using better (and more expensive)&#xD;
        materials, and prioritise our decisions for a remedial process that will&#xD;
        take many years to complete" [a].&#xD;
    Other museums have changed their practices as a result of using our&#xD;
      dosimeters. The Museo Bellas Artes in Valencia, for example, used&#xD;
      dosimeters to monitor the conditions within microclimate frames. As a&#xD;
      result of these tests, the museum now only uses acid-free materials inside&#xD;
      the frames, and avoids certain materials, such as chloroform which was&#xD;
      previously used in the joints of the frames. The dosimeters have also been&#xD;
      used to identify pollutants from cleaning products used in regular&#xD;
      maintenance in the museum [b].&#xD;
    Our dosimeters were used in 2007-8 by English Heritage to assess the&#xD;
      oxidising potential of the atmosphere in two of their properties: Apsley&#xD;
      House and Kenwood House, both of which house internationally important&#xD;
      painting collections. The analyses allowed important management decisions&#xD;
      to be taken on refitting the air filtration system and the impact of dust&#xD;
      from the gravel at the entrance to Kenwood House. The lead-coated PQC&#xD;
      crystals determined the risk to paintings from microclimate frames used to&#xD;
      protect them against relative humidity fluctuations and internally&#xD;
      generated pollutants. The research has increased the use of such frames&#xD;
      that are now a standard approach to displaying vulnerable paintings in&#xD;
      historic house environments [c].&#xD;
    Use of dosimeters in art transport: the Lady with an Ermine&#xD;
    In 2011, our dosimeters provided vital information during the transport&#xD;
      and exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine. There&#xD;
      had been considerable controversy about whether the painting should be&#xD;
      able to leave its permanent home in Poland [d] but, as part of a&#xD;
      monitoring programme, our dosimeters were placed within the micro-climate&#xD;
      showcase in which the painting was exhibited at the Royal Palace in Madrid&#xD;
      to monitor the level of corrosiveness of the air within the frame. Art&#xD;
      transport company SIT-Artyd report that this monitoring showed: "good&#xD;
        results that warranted the continuity of the tour to London and Berlin,&#xD;
        before the return to home in Poland" [e]. As a result of&#xD;
      this successful experience, SIT are now promoting and including the&#xD;
      dosimetry in their exhibition, storage and transport services for museums&#xD;
      in Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona.&#xD;
    Dissemination of our research to professional conservators&#xD;
    We have disseminated our research findings to professional conservators&#xD;
      across Europe and beyond, through our collaborative work, and through&#xD;
      presentation of our results at a series of workshops and conferences aimed&#xD;
      at professionals. For example, through the IDAP project we developed an&#xD;
      algorithm for processing AFM images to allow damage assessment of collagen&#xD;
      fibres. Damage to collagen at the fibre and fibril level is now taught at&#xD;
      regular workshops held by the School of Conservation in Denmark [g].&#xD;
      Odlyha herself has presented at many conferences, including in Turin,&#xD;
      Vienna, Evora, Portugal, and recently in Madrid and has participated in&#xD;
      workshops held in London and Madrid. These were well attended by&#xD;
      conservation professionals from many organisations including the British&#xD;
      Museum the National Gallery in London, and the Mus&amp;#233;e National Picasso&#xD;
      (Paris) [i]. Odlyha has also edited, and written an introduction&#xD;
      to, a chapter on cultural heritage in the Journal of Thermal Analysis and&#xD;
      Calorimetry (May 2011).&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Research by Marianne Odlyha and her group at the Department of Biological&#xD;
      Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London, has led to the development of&#xD;
      minimally invasive analytical methods and portable tools (dosimeters) for&#xD;
      assessing damage to historical artefacts. These dosimeters are now in use&#xD;
      at locations around the world, including the Tate Gallery's store rooms,&#xD;
      English Heritage properties (Apsley House) and museums in Ghent, Cracow&#xD;
      and Mexico. Methods for assessing damage, and for mitigation of pollutant&#xD;
      impact on objects in museum enclosures, have been disseminated to&#xD;
      conservation professionals through workshops and training courses held&#xD;
      across Europe. The assessment and prevention of damage is vital to&#xD;
      conserve the cultural as well as the monetary value of artefacts.&#xD;

      assessment of damage to heritage materials, developing new ways of&#xD;
      detecting damage, analysing what is causing it, and finding the best way&#xD;
      of preventing further damage. We have focussed on the microclimates around&#xD;
      objects, for example inside enclosures such as painting frames and museum&#xD;
      display cases Working with collaborators in many European countries, we&#xD;
      have adapted and optimised minimally invasive analytical methods for&#xD;
      assessing damage.&#xD;
    Our early research, beginning in the mid-90s, developed paint dosimeters&#xD;
      to assess the effect of environmental factors, including pollutants, on&#xD;
      canvas-supported paintings, combining this with characterisation of&#xD;
      physicochemical alterations in paintings. This work was undertaken as part&#xD;
      of a research consortium (co-ordinated by Odlyha at Birkbeck) working with&#xD;
      curators, conservation scientists and conservator-restorers, including at&#xD;
      the Tate Gallery in London. It was the first time that changes in paint&#xD;
      media and artists' varnishes were characterised at the macro and molecular&#xD;
      levels in accelerated aged paint films prepared according to traditional&#xD;
      techniques [1].&#xD;
    Following on from this work, we began development of an electronic&#xD;
      dosimeter to assess possible damage to historical artefacts. We&#xD;
      collaborated with QuartzTec, a small UK company, to modify their existing&#xD;
      commercial instruments for suitability of operation in museum environments&#xD;
      and for continuous electronic recording of data. Novel coatings were&#xD;
      applied to piezoelectric quartz crystals (PQC). These were based on&#xD;
      artists' paint media and were found to be sensitive to the presence of&#xD;
      photo-oxidizing agents. These devices were tested through an EU-wide&#xD;
      project, entitled `Monitoring of Indoor Environments for Cultural Heritage&#xD;
      Preservation' (MIMIC), with devices being placed in seven major European&#xD;
      museums, castles and historic houses, including the Petrie Museum at UCL,&#xD;
      and English Heritage and National Trust properties. Research groups&#xD;
      interacted with the conservators and arranged for exposure and&#xD;
      documentation of the dosimeters together with monitoring of climate and&#xD;
      pollutant data. This enabled determination of dose-response functions for&#xD;
      the coatings and estimation of damage threshold levels [2].&#xD;
    In 2006 we collaborated on a further EU project (SENSORGAN) to examine&#xD;
      corrosion in lead-based organ pipes. Due to the size of the pipes, and&#xD;
      the need to monitor the air flowing into the pipes, we had to further&#xD;
      adapt our electronics, in particular by miniaturising the device. Also,&#xD;
      another coating was developed which was sensitive to the volatile organic&#xD;
      acids emitted from the wooden components of the organ and which were&#xD;
      identified as the cause of corrosion. Our main collaborators were Chalmers&#xD;
      University, Gothenburg, who provided support for calibrating the coated&#xD;
      PQC dosimeters and analytical information on the coatings. The new model&#xD;
      dosimeters were trialled in St Botolph's in London and in churches in&#xD;
      Sweden and Cracow. Concurrently, we collaborated on another EU project&#xD;
      (PROPAINT) with the University of Pisa on assessment of damage to&#xD;
      varnished paintings in microclimate frames. We further adapted our devices&#xD;
      to monitor conditions within the enclosed microclimate frames which are&#xD;
      used to protect paintings and also modified the electronics to allow for&#xD;
      battery operated devices. The overall research prototype included two&#xD;
      calibrated coatings sensitive to photooxidising agents and to volatile&#xD;
      organic acids [3].&#xD;
    We have played key roles in the research consortia of two projects&#xD;
      looking at damage to historical parchment (IDAP) and to historic&#xD;
      tapestries from collections at Hampton Court and in the Royal Palace in&#xD;
      Madrid (MODHT). In the former, we collaborated with Dr Laurent Bozec at&#xD;
      the UCL Eastman Dental Institute to develop methods for assessing damage&#xD;
      in collagen-based materials. This introduced for the first time the use of&#xD;
      atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micro-thermal analysis for&#xD;
      characterising changes in collagen at the nano-scale level, and mechanical&#xD;
      testing in controlled environments. A method for quantification of AFM&#xD;
      images of collagen was developed; this provided a measure of the extent of&#xD;
      intact ordered structure present in the imaged surface and hence damage [4,5].&#xD;
      Similar techniques were also applied to textiles (wool and silk) to&#xD;
      evaluate the extent of damage in historical tapestry samples [6].&#xD;

    The first therapeutic applications of modulating the interaction of serum
      amyloid P with its ligands revolved around compounds that interact with it
      to remove it from pathogenic amyloid fibres and therefore render those
      fibres more vulnerable to proteolytic degradation. A lead compound, CPHPC,
      was developed and shown to cross-link two SAP pentamers, removing the
      protein both from circulation and from interaction with amyloid. The
      discovery of this compound was critically dependent on the insights into
      cooperative ligand binding discovered through the decamericSAP/dAMP
      structure solved in Wood's lab at Birkbeck and reported in reference [2]
      above.
    A biotech company, Pentraxin Therapeutics Ltd (PTL), was spun out of UCL
      in 2001 to design drugs for the treatment of amyloid-related diseases and
      develop them; serum amyloid P became its first validated target [a],
      resulting in a series of patents. For example, in 2008, formulations of
      CPHPC were patented as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease [b].
      Preliminary results (published by the Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute
      Phase Proteins) showed SAP depletion in vivo [c]; however
      despite these and other promising results in mouse models and human data
      showing that CPHPC causes a fall in circulating concentrations of SAP,
      this drug has made little progress in clinical trials as a monotherapy for
      Alzheimer's disease.
    Wood and his co-workers in the Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase
      Proteins at UCL and at PTL have now licensed a combination of CPHPC and
      anti-SAP antibodies to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a treatment for systemic
      amyloidosis [d]. This therapy involves administering CPHPC (i/d
      GSK2315698) first to remove SAP from the patients' circulation and then
      administering an anti-SAP antibody (i/d GSK2398852); with no SAP in
      circulation, this antibody should be directed to amyloid-bound SAP to
      activate the patients' immune systems and destroy the amyloid.
    The first Phase I clinical trial of the combination therapy began
      recruiting patients diagnosed with systemic amyloidosis in June 2013 [e].
      This is a two-part trial; the first part is a dose escalation study to
      determine the safety of the two components and the second will assess its
      dose-response and effect on SAP concentrations in more detail. It is
      co-sponsored by three London hospitals and so contributes to the
      continuation of skilled employment in the UK, both at GSK and at these
      sites. GSK have hailed the importance of their collaboration with the
      Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins as part of their strategy
      of academic engagement in drug discovery [d, f]. The potential
      value of this combination therapy has already attracted the attention of
      patient groups, despite its early stage of development; Amyloidosis
      Australia has described it as "...the most wonderful news about
        Amyloidosis we had heard in the past 8 years" [g].
    The known function of circulating SAP as a mediator of the inflammatory
      response is being exploited by the innovative biotech company Promedior
      Inc., based in Lexington, MA, USA. Promedior's work focuses on the
      development of recombinant forms of SAP (Pentraxin-2 or PTX-2) as
      treatments for fibrosis. This term refers to the formation of excessive
      connective tissue in response to inflammation, a response that plays an
      important part in many types of chronic organ failure. The mechanism for
      the activity of PTX-2 against fibrosis is based on its specific,
      calcium-mediated recognition of so-called "damage-mediated molecular
      patterns" (DAMPs) which are exposed when cells are damaged. This promotes
      the removal of the damaged proteins by immunoglobulins on the surface of
      macrophages. The mechanism of this interaction was elucidated using recent
      crystallographic data obtained by Promedior, which shows the calcium-and
      immunoglobulin-binding sites lying on opposite sides of the pentraxin
      complex. These studies, also, would not have been possible without access
      to the initial structures obtained by Wood's group at Birkbeck from 1994
      onwards.
    The most advanced compound in the Promedior pipeline is currently (summer
      2013) an injected form of PTX-2 designated PRM-151 [h]. This is in
      early clinical trials for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
      (IPF), a chronic, progressive lung disease that kills about 5,000 people
      annually in the UK. The FDA and EMA have designated PRM-151 as an "orphan
      drug" for this condition, giving Promedior some specific commercial and
      marketing incentives [i]. A Phase I trial in IPF patients and
      healthy volunteers has shown that PTX-2 is safe, suggested that it can
      reduce fibrocyte levels in IPF patients, and recommended it for further
      clinical trials [j, k]; a Phase 2 trial is now in progress.
    Pentraxin formulations are also being developed for fibrous diseases of
      the retina. A Phase 2 clinical trial of PRM-151 to prevent scarring
      following trabeculectomy in glaucoma enrolled 124 patients from 14
      European study centres and was completed in November 2012 but is not yet
      published. A variant form of recombinant SAP, PTX-169, has now been
      developed for injection into the eye. Pre-clinical results presented at
      the Association for Research in Vision and Opthalmology in 2012 indicate
      that this compound shows promise in diabetic retinopathy and age-related
      macular degeneration, each of which affects millions of people worldwide [l];
      clinical trials are planned. Promedior is a thriving company and its
      SAP-based programmes make a significant contribution to economic growth
      and skilled employment in Massachusetts.

    Serum amyloid P, or pentraxin-2, is a pentameric calcium-binding protein
      that binds to amyloid fibrils. It has been implicated in the protection of
      those fibrils from proteolytic digestion and in the immune response to
      tissue damage. The structure of pentraxin-2 was first solved by Steve Wood
      and his co-workers in Tom Blundell's lab at Birkbeck in the 1990s. Wood
      has continued his work on the pentraxins at UCL, and the company Pentraxin
      Therapeutics Ltd was spun out of UCL to design and develop
      pentraxin-binding ligands (based on its structure) as potential treatments
      for Alzheimer's disease and amyloidosis. Promedior Inc. in the US is
      developing recombinant forms of pentraxin to control fibrosis. Several of
      these molecules are now in clinical trials.

    Deposits of a fibrillar form of protein known as amyloid have been
      associated with a wide range of human diseases including Alzheimer's
      disease, the most common form of dementia. Amyloid fibres formed from
      different proteins have essentially the same "cross-beta" structure. A
      number of other proteins have been discovered to be associated with
      amyloid fibres, among them a protein called serum amyloid P (SAP). This
      protein has been shown to not be required for fibre formation in vitro
      but is now known to stabilise the fibres in vivo.
    Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of this protein has been an
      essential pre-requisite to understanding the mechanism of its interaction
      with amyloid. The structure of the native, pentameric form of SAP was
      first determined by a group led by Steve Wood in the former Department of
      Crystallography at Birkbeck, working under the overall direction of
      Professor (now Sir) Tom Blundell. This work was published in Nature
      in 1994 [1] and the structure released by the Protein Bank with
      the code 1SAC. The paper had attracted 336 citations by August 2013.
    Serum amyloid P is known to bind to amyloid fibres; to other protein
      ligands including fibronectin and glycosaminoglycans; and to DNA in a
      calcium dependent manner. This 3D structure, the first to be determined
      for a pentraxin, revealed that each SAP monomer has a fold remarkably
      similar to that seen in a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins, the
      legume lectins. Binding positions were identified in the crystal structure
      for two calcium ions, largely coordinated by the side chains of negatively
      charged amino acids that are conserved throughout the SAP family. SAP is
      known to be remarkably resistant to protease digestion in the presence of
      calcium, and this may be partly responsible for the protease resistance of
      amyloid fibrils in vivo.
    Following the determination of the crystal structure of SAP, the group
      undertook a comparative analysis of the pentraxin family, comparing the
      sequences, tertiary structures and quaternary arrangements of SAP with
      human C-reactive protein (CRP), Syrian hamster SAP and Limulus polyphemus
      CRP. Calcium-mediated ligand binding by each of these proteins was found
      to be similar, but sequence differences in the hydrophobic pocket
      explained the differential ligand specificities exhibited by the
      homologous proteins [2].
    Work by Wood and Dr Erhard Hohenester, a postdoctoral fellow at Birkbeck,
      to solve the structure of a decameric complex of SAP with a bound ligand,
      2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-mono-phosphate (dAMP), was undertaken at Birkbeck
      (and written up and published after Wood left in 1996) [3]. This
      novel structure for the SAP-ligand complex showed the calcium sites
      shielded against competing ligands and illustrated that the modest
      affinity of this protein for small ligands could be enhanced by
      cooperativity between the subunits of a complex. This cooperativity in
      ligand binding was utilised in the discovery of the candidate drug
      molecule CPHPC, discussed below. Wood and his co-workers originally
      speculated that knowledge of the binding mode of SAP to calcium and to
      carbohydrate- and phosphate-containing compounds might lead to the
      development of drugs to treat amyloidosis by modulating SAP binding to
      amyloid and hence amyloid's proteolytic digestion. In work started at
      Birkbeck, his group later published the structure of SAP bound to a
      carbohydrate ligand, confirming many of these speculations [4].
    Wood has continued his productive work on amyloid proteins after leaving
      Birkbeck, first at Southampton and then at UCL. He is now a Professor in
      the Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine,
      University College London, and he continues to collaborate with his former
      colleagues at Birkbeck as a core member of the ISMB. His current work
      builds upon the work described above, including targeting the related
      PTX-1C-reactive protein for new treatments for myocardial infarction and
      stroke.

    Global eye healthcare company Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb drew on the principles of&#xD;
      bio-inspiration to develop a new contact lens solution that mimics the&#xD;
      natural fluids of the human eye. By studying how the eye keeps itself&#xD;
      clean, hydrated and germ-free, it brought together three bio-inspired&#xD;
      innovations to create a unique product: Biotrue&amp;#8482; (http://www.biotrue.co.uk).&#xD;
      It uses a lubricant found naturally in the human eye, matches the pH of&#xD;
      healthy tears and ensures beneficial tear proteins remain active. Based on&#xD;
      a decade of research into bio-inspiration derived from natural photonics,&#xD;
      from 2000 to 2010 [3.1 - 3.6] Vukusic acted as a consultant and advisor&#xD;
      for Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb in the development of the brand positioning and core&#xD;
      messaging of Biotrue. Vukusic helped shape the company's definition of&#xD;
      bio-inspiration, which formed the backbone of the marketing and&#xD;
      communications strategy for the product launch.&#xD;
    From May 2009 to September 2011 Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb's communications&#xD;
      efforts about bio-inspiration were aimed at two key target audiences: eye&#xD;
      care professionals (ophthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians) and&#xD;
      consumers. Through the use and description of examples based on his&#xD;
      research into optical bio-inspiration and photonics in nature, Bausch&#xD;
      &amp;amp; Lomb were convinced of the value of using bio-inspiration as the&#xD;
      platform on which to position the Biotrue brand. Bio-inspiration became an&#xD;
      integral part of the company's core messaging, in its efforts to convey&#xD;
      how the Biotrue product is designed in a completely new and different way&#xD;
      &amp;#8212; i.e. `to work more like the eyes'. This resulted in the following brand&#xD;
      promise:&#xD;
    "Nature has always inspired new ideas. It's called bio-inspiration.&#xD;
        And it's leading to some of today's biggest breakthroughs &amp;#8212; including a&#xD;
        lens care solution that looks for inspiration from the most natural&#xD;
        place &amp;#8212; the eye. Biotrue is formulated to work more like the eye."&#xD;
      [5.1]&#xD;
    Specifically to engage with eye care professionals, Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb&#xD;
      drew on a research-based contribution from Vukusic that comprised 16&#xD;
      posters and 154 publications published in 17 countries. This core&#xD;
      messaging on bio-inspiration was delivered to 40,000 eye-care&#xD;
      professionals at 1,000 symposia and seminars in 40 countries [5.1].&#xD;
      Vukusic himself gave 35 presentations on bio-inspiration in the US, UK,&#xD;
      Netherlands, France, Belgium, Russia, Korea, China, Japan and Brazil.&#xD;
      Vukusic authored the introductory feature &amp;#8212; An Introduction to&#xD;
      Bio-inspired Design &amp;#8212; to a 2010 issue of Contact Lens Spectrum [5.2] and&#xD;
      an additional supplement [5.3], the leading magazine for optometrists,&#xD;
      opticians and ophthalmologists. As part of this communication, Vukusic&#xD;
      also featured in three issues of `Visions' Magazine and one issue of&#xD;
      `Optician' [5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7].&#xD;
    To reach consumers, a media campaign was instigated following a press&#xD;
      event and was held in New York in May 2010 at which attendees were&#xD;
      introduced to a video created by Vukusic, from which Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb&#xD;
      secured 285 million web impressions for Biotrue in the national print and&#xD;
      broadcast media. This resulted in consumer familiarity with&#xD;
      bio-inspiration and products `inspired by the natural world', rising&#xD;
      sharply over two periods in 2010, as measured by Directions Research Inc.&#xD;
      In Europe, there were 115 articles published that mentioned&#xD;
      bio-inspiration in relation to Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb's product, reaching 29.7&#xD;
      million users in 15 countries. Around 340,000 Asian consumers across eight&#xD;
      countries were reached through Internet Forum Discussions, videos and two&#xD;
      magazine advertorials. Articles about bio-inspiration featuring quotes and&#xD;
      research from Vukusic reached 313,000 readers in Brazil and Argentina. A&#xD;
      Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb video The World of Bio-inspiration, based on&#xD;
      Vukusic's presentations, has been viewed over 29,000 times [5.1]. This led&#xD;
      to a series of industry and professional communication events resulting&#xD;
      `in a unique impact that is unlike any other new product launch from&#xD;
      Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb,' according to the Director of Medical Affairs Global&#xD;
      Vision Care at Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb [5.1]. In June 2010, Vukusic was invited&#xD;
      to a roundtable discussion [5.8], organised by Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb, at the&#xD;
      annual meeting of the American Optometric Association where he gave a&#xD;
      presentation on bio-inspiration based on his research findings.&#xD;
      Illustrating the importance of the bio-inspiration message, one of the&#xD;
      participants, Dr Bruce Anderson, a fellow of the American Academy of&#xD;
      Optometry, observed: `When patients learn a product is bio-inspired, I&#xD;
      believe their confidence in the product increases. They realise there's&#xD;
      research behind it that makes it more compatible with the eye, and they're&#xD;
      more willing to try it and accept it.' The `highlights' website quotes `physicist&#xD;
        Peter Vukusic, PhD, who has done extensive work to bring bio-inspired&#xD;
        products to the market' [5.8].&#xD;
    Summarising the contribution of Vukusic's research to the commercial&#xD;
      success of Biotrue, the Director of Medical Affairs said:&#xD;
    `The launch of Biotrue has been unprecedented in the lens care&#xD;
        solution category. This is largely due to the excellent consulting&#xD;
        support and insightful guidance by Vukusic in leading us during the&#xD;
        development of the bio-inspiration positioning and our communications&#xD;
        plan. Having been introduced to the United States in June 2010, Biotrue&#xD;
        had launched in 35 countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific&#xD;
        regions by the end of 2011. In the US, Biotrue's market share growth&#xD;
        after one year was five times faster than the previous best-in-class&#xD;
        launch of a lens care solution. Unique bio-inspired positioning has&#xD;
        contributed to highly incremental volume for Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb lens care&#xD;
        products in total.' [5.1]&#xD;

    Natural photonics research by Professor Pete Vukusic at the University of&#xD;
      Exeter was responsible for shaping the successful global communications&#xD;
      strategy of Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb, a world-leading supplier of eye health&#xD;
      products. Drawing on Vukusic's studies into bio-inspiration, Bausch &amp;amp;&#xD;
      Lomb built its core brand messaging for a major new lens product around&#xD;
      the ability of nature to inspire technological breakthroughs. Outreach&#xD;
      campaigns targeting media and optometry professionals took Vukusic's&#xD;
      research to an international audience, raising wider public awareness of&#xD;
      the concept of bio-inspiration. Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb attributed their&#xD;
      subsequent rapid sales growth to Vukusic's work.&#xD;

    Bio-inspiration &amp;#8212; the application of processes observed in the natural&#xD;
      world to the design of new technologies &amp;#8212; is an increasingly important&#xD;
      stimulus for innovation. Bio-inspired products have become a popular&#xD;
      marketing strategy for manufacturers to attract `conscientious consumers':&#xD;
      those who may be attracted to a particular product due to the perception&#xD;
      that naturally inspired designs are efficient, effective and `natural'.&#xD;
    Research led by Pete Vukusic, Professor in BioPhotonics (joined Exeter&#xD;
      1998) at the University of Exeter's School of Physics and Astronomy seeks&#xD;
      to understand the photonic properties of nanostructures in living systems&#xD;
      [3.1, 3.2], drawing on techniques from across the physical and biological&#xD;
      sciences. The aim is to discover and characterise photonic system designs&#xD;
      that exist in the natural world, which may inspire breakthrough&#xD;
      technological applications [3.3, 3.4, 3.5].&#xD;
    Vukusic's research group at Exeter has advanced a wider understanding of&#xD;
      photonics in biological systems. As an example, the study by Vukusic et&#xD;
       al. (2007) of a small Southeast Asian beetle revealed how its&#xD;
      brilliant whiteness is created by a material only five microns thick&#xD;
      [3.3]. This material is a highly disordered, filament-based photonic solid&#xD;
      that, through optimised spatial arrangement of its scattering centres, has&#xD;
      a quality of whiteness equivalent to commercial paper products upward of&#xD;
      50 times its thickness. The group is now collaborating with the paper&#xD;
      development division of French multinational Imerys Plc to design paper&#xD;
      formulations with less mineral coating making it lighter with consequently&#xD;
      lower product transport costs.&#xD;
    A 2004 paper by Vukusic analysed the nature of the black and unreflective&#xD;
      surfaces of arthropod wings [3.4]. It described the discovery and&#xD;
      characterisation of a significant structural component to the blackness of&#xD;
      some natural surfaces. These `black' structures are aperiodic, in complete&#xD;
      contrast to the structural periodicity causing vivid iridescent colour&#xD;
      that he identified and published in Nature a year earlier [3.1].&#xD;
      The aperiodicity strongly incoherently scatters light, increasing the&#xD;
      light's path-length through the absorbing pigmentation and thereby&#xD;
      enhancing the overall absorption cross-section of the system.&#xD;
    An investigation of several Papilio butterflies [3.5, 3.6] led to&#xD;
      the discovery that the bright wing colouration of this group results from&#xD;
      cooperation between highly fluorescent pigment, a 2D photonic crystal and&#xD;
      a highly tuned distributed Bragg reflector. (Previously, fluorescently&#xD;
      coloured systems and structurally coloured systems were characterised&#xD;
      separately in many different animal phyla; however, none had indicated an&#xD;
      interaction between the nanostructure and emission from the pigment.) This&#xD;
      work successfully demonstrated that the butterflies' wing colouration&#xD;
      exploits high efficiency fluorescence [3.6] from a 2D photonic crystal of&#xD;
      cuticle and air, the design of which prevents emission of light in two&#xD;
      dimensions but assists its emission in the third dimension (namely the&#xD;
      light is emitted upwards and out of the wing towards an observer). The&#xD;
      Bragg reflector located directly beneath the 2D photonic crystal ensures&#xD;
      both the reflection of non-absorbed photons of the correct colour and&#xD;
      upward-redirection of the downward-emitted fluorescence. High visibility&#xD;
      blue/green light emission is achieved through the use of significantly&#xD;
      less fluorescent pigmentation than would otherwise be necessary if this&#xD;
      nanostructure arrangement did not exist. This is a well optimised and&#xD;
      adapted optical system, the light extraction mechanism of which is&#xD;
      analogous to that of the new range of ultra-high efficiency light emitting&#xD;
      diodes.&#xD;
    The study of these natural designs provided Vukusic with an extensive&#xD;
      understanding of how the power of bio-inspiration could be harnessed for&#xD;
      technology transfer, prompting an approach from one of the world's largest&#xD;
      suppliers of eye health products: Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb.&#xD;

    Diamond modelling research at Exeter has made an impact in two principal&#xD;
      areas. It has provided De Beers with the scientific understanding it&#xD;
      needed to develop techniques to identify synthetic and treated diamonds,&#xD;
      maintaining consumer confidence in De Beers' diamond trading and, by way&#xD;
      of the company's long-established dominance, in the diamond industry as a&#xD;
      whole. Secondly, it was a factor in a decision by De Beers to invest &amp;#163;20m&#xD;
      in strengthening its research base in the UK, creating high-level&#xD;
      employment for UK scientists [5.2].&#xD;
    The continued success of De Beers is crucial to the employment of&#xD;
      thousands of people around the world. The De Beers Group employs&#xD;
      approximately 20,000 people, of whom 17,000 are based in Africa. The&#xD;
      company has mining operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and&#xD;
      Canada and is part of the Anglo-American Group that has 145,000 employees&#xD;
      in 30 countries. De Beers sells approximately 40% of the world's rough&#xD;
      diamonds, thus supporting a huge number of downstream jobs in the diamond&#xD;
      trade, from polishing through grading to jewellery manufacture and&#xD;
      retailing. In 2011, De Beers had sales of $7.4 billion with earnings&#xD;
      before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $1.7&#xD;
      billion. According to the Head of Physics [5.2] at the De Beers Research&#xD;
      Centre in Maidenhead, a key factor in achieving such a strong performance&#xD;
      was the high consumer demand that drove price increases for rough and&#xD;
      polished diamonds. This, he says, "was underpinned by work supporting&#xD;
      consumer confidence in diamonds in the face of rapid development over the&#xD;
      last 20 years of processes for production of synthetic diamond and&#xD;
      artificial treatment of natural diamond. It is vitally important for the&#xD;
      diamond trade that consumers can buy diamonds without fear of product&#xD;
      misrepresentation."&#xD;
    Referring specifically to Exeter's contribution, De Beers Head of Physics&#xD;
      said: "Prof Jones's work since 1993 in modelling defects in diamond has&#xD;
      played a major role in helping us build the foundation of knowledge on&#xD;
      which our identification methodology is based and has been an important&#xD;
      factor in enabling the detection and containment of recent attempts to&#xD;
      sell synthetic or treated diamond fraudulently as natural untreated&#xD;
      diamond."&#xD;
    Jones's research, supported by two collaborative awards in science and&#xD;
      engineering (CASE) PhD studentships funded jointly by EPSRC and De Beers&#xD;
      [5.3, 5.4], helped the company to develop and test the idea that vacancy&#xD;
      clusters are responsible for brown colouration in natural diamonds with&#xD;
      low nitrogen content. It enabled De Beers to understand the mechanism by&#xD;
      which the brown colour is removed by relatively short high temperature&#xD;
      heat treatments, and the identity and stability of by-products of this&#xD;
      heat treatment. The work also helped unravel the link between&#xD;
      nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen defects and their optical signatures. These&#xD;
      defects have not been detected in any natural diamond but tend to be&#xD;
      present in synthetic diamond, changing its colour. Prof Jones' work helped&#xD;
      De Beers understand these phenomena. De Beers Head of Physics concludes:&#xD;
      "[Exeter's research] has therefore been of fundamental importance in the&#xD;
      development of a robust identification methodology that has safeguarded&#xD;
      consumer confidence and therefore many jobs in the diamond industry."&#xD;
    De Beers cannot quantify the impact of Exeter's work in economic terms;&#xD;
      to remain one step ahead of counterfeiters, the company discloses very&#xD;
      little information about the methods they use to characterise diamonds.&#xD;
      But further evidence that Jones's research has informed practice at De&#xD;
      Beers comes in journal articles published by De Beers scientists [5.5,&#xD;
      5.6, 5.7], which reference the work. It is also highlighted by De Beers'&#xD;
      decision, on the basis of Jones's results, to award two further CASE&#xD;
      studentships in 2009 to academics at the University of Manchester, and to&#xD;
      support further experiments at Helsinki University of Technology. The&#xD;
      published paper from Helsinki [5.8] in 2009 cited Jones's work in their&#xD;
      own calculations and acknowledged discussions with Jones during their own&#xD;
      research. Jones's work is generally accepted as explaining the role of&#xD;
      vacancy clusters in the colour of diamonds.&#xD;
    According to De Beers Head of Physics, De Beers has an increasingly&#xD;
      strong research base within the UK, employing 56 highly trained people,&#xD;
      including many PhD scientists, at its DTC research centre in Maidenhead.&#xD;
      The DTC collaborates closely with Element Six (E6), part of the De Beers&#xD;
      Group and the world's leading supplier of synthetic industrial diamonds.&#xD;
      De Beers Head of Physics reports that in 2013 E6's global R&amp;amp;D will be&#xD;
      consolidated into the E6 Global Innovation Centre (http://www.e6.com/gic)&#xD;
      near Oxford, where "a pipeline of innovative products will be developed&#xD;
      for customers in industries from oil and gas drilling to machining and&#xD;
      electronics."&#xD;
    He said: "This &amp;#163;20m investment is consolidating E6's existing global&#xD;
      innovation teams in the UK and the choice of location was strongly&#xD;
      influenced by the excellence of UK research in diamond science as&#xD;
      exemplified by Professor Jones at Exeter." He added: "De Beers organizes&#xD;
      an annual conference to encourage presentation and discussion of new&#xD;
      research relevant to the diamond industry at which Prof Jones has been an&#xD;
      active and valued contributor." [5.9]&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    An atomistic modelling program developed at Exeter University has been&#xD;
      used to make a significant, recognised contribution to the strong business&#xD;
      performance of the De Beers Group, the world's leading diamond company. It&#xD;
      gave De Beers the confidence to fund the successful development of new&#xD;
      methods to identify synthetic and treated diamonds, which the company says&#xD;
      has minimised the impact of fraudulent behaviour on consumer confidence,&#xD;
      supported jobs in the global diamond trade, contributed to sales of $7.4bn&#xD;
      in one year alone and was a factor in its decision to invest &amp;#163;20m in new&#xD;

    Natural diamonds are among the world's most precious natural resources;&#xD;
      diamond jewellery had a global retail value of $72 billion in 2012&#xD;
      according to management consulting firm Bain &amp;amp; Company [5.1]. However,&#xD;
      the last two decades have seen a rapid development in the production of&#xD;
      synthetic diamond and the artificial enhancement of colour of natural&#xD;
      diamond. The increasing quality of counterfeit natural diamonds represents&#xD;
      a serious threat to consumer confidence. Bain &amp;amp; Company reported that&#xD;
      2011 marked the appearance of a large batch of synthetic diamonds believed&#xD;
      by their dealer to be natural, highlighting the need for better techniques&#xD;
      to guarantee the authenticity of natural diamonds and preserve trust in&#xD;
      the industry.&#xD;
    Research by Robert Jones, Emeritus Professor (at Exeter since 1971) in&#xD;
      Physics has developed new methods to understand colour caused by defects&#xD;
      in diamonds and to distinguish between natural and artificial or&#xD;
      heat-treated diamonds. The new methods are based on prior studies by Jones&#xD;
      into the defects that exist in a wide range of materials. A computer code&#xD;
      &amp;#8212; AIMPRO (Abinitio Modelling Program) &amp;#8212; that calculates, among other&#xD;
      things, the optical properties of materials was first developed by Jones&#xD;
      [3.1] and now has an international community of users. It analyses the&#xD;
      structural, electrical, optical and mechanical properties of solids in&#xD;
      order to identify material defects. It is unusual in that it uses Gaussian&#xD;
      functions (similar to a normal distribution bell curve) to represent the&#xD;
      quantum-mechanical wavefunctions, and hence the electron density within a&#xD;
      solid, rather than the more commonly used plane waves. Fewer Gaussian&#xD;
      functions than plane waves are needed per atom meaning that larger unit&#xD;
      cells can be investigated.&#xD;
    Jones used AIMPRO to model complex defects in Gallium Nitride and Silicon&#xD;
      [3.2, 3.3]. The code works by arranging atoms in a structure. If the atoms&#xD;
      are aligned incorrectly, the code calculates the force between the atoms&#xD;
      and rearranges the structure until equilibrium is reached. Then the&#xD;
      optical properties and other properties such as the electron energy loss&#xD;
      spectra (EELS) are calculated.&#xD;
    At the request of the Diamond Trading Company (DTC), the rough diamond&#xD;
      distribution arm of De Beers, Jones used AIMPRO to determine the optical&#xD;
      properties and EELS signature of various defects in the diamond. Three&#xD;
      types of defect exist in natural diamond: vacancies and interstitials&#xD;
      (where an atom is either missing from or added to an otherwise regular&#xD;
      structure), impurities (which replace carbon atoms in the lattice), and&#xD;
      dislocations (where neighbouring planes of atoms have slipped in relation&#xD;
      to each other). Jones began by calculating the energy spectrum of the most&#xD;
      stable dislocation that is found in all types of diamond. He showed that&#xD;
      the dislocation itself is not responsible for the colour of brown diamonds&#xD;
      &amp;#8212; the most common colour variety of natural diamonds. Instead he proved&#xD;
      that it is the vacancy clusters that can give rise to the brown colour and&#xD;
      he argued that such clusters are introduced by movement of dislocations&#xD;
      when a diamond is plastically deformed under heat and pressure [3.4]. The&#xD;
      vacancy clusters and therefore the brown colour can be removed by exposure&#xD;
      to 2000&amp;#176;C heat. Crucially, Jones discovered that this causes the vacancy&#xD;
      clusters to decay into other types of defect, such as nitrogen-vacancy&#xD;
      defects, the optical properties of which are well known. Counterfeiters&#xD;
      are not yet able to remove these new defects, which show up through&#xD;
      optical spectroscopy used by companies like De Beers to validate their&#xD;
      natural diamonds.&#xD;
    Further studies considered the optical properties of a number of other&#xD;
      defects such as silicon and nitrogen vacancies, all of which are present&#xD;
      in treated diamond and cause colour changes. More recent work has dealt&#xD;
      with the properties of graphene and related doping mechanisms [3.5],&#xD;
      [3.6].&#xD;

    Researchers trained at Exeter and supervised by Sambles in the
      fundamental physics of liquid crystal devices developed with others the
      novel technology and knowledge transfer essential to the creation of a
      spinout company. This company has gone on to establish a dominant share of
      what is set to become a multi-billion-pound global market in electronic
      labelling for retailers. In the words of ZBD Founder and Director of
      Technology [5.1] "On so many levels from: specific knowledge of grating
      alignment of liquid crystals, general liquid crystal fabrication
      techniques; access to theoretical modelling; to learning how to solve
      problems as a team; I've benefitted from my time at Exeter and DERA and
      ZBD have benefitted from my training."
    Jones, Bryan-Brown and Wood raised &amp;#163;1.5m in Venture Capital funding to
      create DERA's first ever spinout company ZBD Displays Ltd in 2000. The
      company has since grown to employ nearly 60 people, based mainly in the
      UK, but also in offices in the United States, France, Germany and Hong
      Kong. Twenty of the 60-strong staff are scientists and engineers, seven of
      whom are at PhD level. It is an indication of the influence of Exeter's
      research expertise that four of those seven PhD students completed their
      degrees under the supervision of Sambles and Barnes at Exeter, in addition
      to the fact that Bryan-Brown and Wood began their liquid crystal grating
      studies at Exeter.
    ZBD was founded to exploit the invention by Bryan-Brown, Brown and Jones
      of the Zenithal Bistable Device, which is based on the alignment of liquid
      crystals on gratings. The technology enabled the creation of a new type of
      low-power LCD. The image it generates remains on the display even when the
      power is switched off, meaning it operates at a fraction of the cost of
      traditional (TFT) LCD displays and is more environmentally friendly.
      Supermarkets use it for displaying pricing and product information instead
      of printed labels, as it can be updated instantly, and it is applicable to
      anything that has a display and is battery-powered, such as an mp3 player
      or e-tablet. The technology enables organisations to update hundreds of
      e-paper displays from a central source, ensuring that pricing and other
      information is accurate and consistent, while saving on consumables and
      the time and effort required to replace paper labels.
    ZBD is now the world's leading provider of fully graphic e-paper display
      systems for retailers. As a result of underpinning research into grating
      alignment of liquid crystals, the company possesses what it describes as
      "an extensive intellectual property portfolio and unparalleled expertise
      in LCD design and manufacture". Growth has been rapid. ZBD has raised over
      &amp;#163;50m of venture funding and, since launching shelf-edge label products in
      2008, has sold several million displays across Europe [5.2, 5.3, 5.4]. In
      2012, it reported for the previous financial year [5.2]:
    - Revenue growth to $19.6m (&amp;#163;12.6m) from $6.4m (&amp;#163;4.1m), maintaining an
      annual growth rate of 200% since commercialisation began in 2008;
    - A presence in 15 retail sectors in 24 countries and at least 50% of the
      world's leading retailers engaged with, or in discussions with, ZBD;
    - Growth in retail clients from 52 to 130 with e-paper for retail the
      primary revenue driver;
    - Growth in non-retail customer numbers from seven to 40 across eight
      sectors.
    In 2012, ZBD reached the number one spot in the Deloitte Technology Fast
      50 [5.3], a ranking of the 50 fastest-growing technology companies in the
      UK. Rankings are based on percentage revenue growth over five years. ZBD's
      revenues grew 17,910% during this period. In the same year, ZBD ranked fifth
      in the Sunday Times' Tech Track 100 league table [5.4, 5.5]. Also in 2012,
      ZBD won an Innovation Award from the Institute of Physics [5.6] for its
      unique e-paper display technology. ZBD's Chief Technical Officer Cliff
      Jones said that the award was "testament to ZBD's focus on applying new
      physics to our unique bistable e-paper technology" [5.7].
    The company continues to develop novel displays based upon liquid crystal
      grating structures, and maintains a world-leading expertise in liquid
      crystal alignment that derives directly from its roots in the Exeter
      group. Its CEO believes its investment in R&amp;amp;D (around 50% of its
      funding) is a principal reason behind the company's success in 2009 when
      it invested over &amp;#163;3m. The impact of Exeter's research training can be
      traced, through ZBD's success, to the benefits experienced by ZBD's key
      customers. Coop Denmark, a Danish retail giant with revenues of $9.2bn,
      has introduced ZBD's electronic shelf labelling to more than 100 of its
      stores because it "can use it to make our operations more efficient,
      launch promotions more effectively and differentiate our stores from our
      competitors" [5.8]. UK baby specialist Kiddicare has committed to using
      the labelling in ten new superstores scheduled to open in 2013. Norwegian
      discount retail chain Bunnpris is using ZBD's technology in its 200 stores
      [5.9], as are Italian supermarket giant SISA [5.9], T-Mobile Austria,
      Estonia's leading telecoms provider EMT, U.S. electronics retailer Vann's
      and Dutch electrical retailer Plasmadiscounter [5.9]. In September 2012,
      ZBD opened a new HQ in Paris [5.10].
    To fully deploy e-paper displays across all products in all retailers
      amounts to a global market size of $100B. While this is large investment
      it is still much smaller than the annual efficiency savings that can be
      made by retailers by avoiding waste, avoiding lost sales as well as fully
      utilising their active pricing systems. While paper signage has acted as a
      bottleneck to fully implementing retail IT, electronic signage now finally
      unlocks a fully integrated system.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Researchers, and the work they undertook at the University of Exeter
      during the 1990s, led to the formation of the Defence Evaluation and
      Research Agency's (now QinetiQ) first spinout company: ZBD Displays Ltd.
      Achieving revenue growth of 17,910% over the last five years, ZBD's unique
      electronic retail signage and shelf-edge labelling technology is used by
      major retailers all over the world. The invention used the know-how
      developed by ZBD's company founders whose R&amp;amp;D and engineering teams
      all include former postgraduates from the School of Physics and Astronomy,
      who acquired their expertise under the supervision of Professors Roy
      Sambles and Bill Barnes.

    How LCD research created one of the UK's fastest growing companies
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Physics</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    Liquid Crystals Displays (LCDs) are a multi-billion-pound-a-year
      industry. Understanding the fundamental physics behind the operation of
      the liquid crystals within these devices is essential for the development
      of the next generation of devices. Many liquid crystals are composed of
      rod-shaped molecules that align roughly parallel to each other. Dictating
      their alignment by applying a voltage across a thin layer of the liquid
      crystal material allows the amount of light transmitted through them to be
      controlled. To advance the technology further and meet the huge market
      demand for lower-power LCDs, further developments in understanding the
      alignment of the liquid crystal layer are needed.
    Since 1986, research at the University of Exeter's School of Physics and
      Astronomy, led by Roy Sambles, Professor of Experimental Physics (since
      1991), has sought to investigate new optical techniques to characterise
      the alignment properties of a range of liquid crystals. This work was
      developed by Dr Guy Bryan-Brown, (PhD 1988-91) under Sambles' supervision,
      to incorporate optical gratings into the system. This was extended by Dr
      Emma Wood, (PhD 1989-92) again supervised by Sambles, who studied the
      geometry of grating coupling to optical modes in a thin,
      voltage-controllable liquid crystal layer [3.1] and how this might be
      employed in LCD technology.
    In 1990, the Exeter group constructed a mini-interferometer for the
      fabrication of gratings and devised ways to optically characterise liquid
      crystal cells containing such gratings. With Sambles acting as a
      consultant to the LCD group at DERA (then RSRE) led by Dr Cliff Jones,
      (Display Group Technical Leader), further collaborative work on grating
      alignment in nematic liquid crystal devices ensued with Jones's team
      working closely with Sambles' group at Exeter.
    After joining DERA, Bryan-Brown continued work on gratings and liquid
      crystals, establishing a capability for fabrication and assessment of the
      grating structures derived directly from the techniques pioneered at
      Exeter. He and Sambles co-authored early papers [3.2, 3.3] in this area.
      Between 1994 and 1996 Bryan-Brown was the industrial supervisor for Wood,
      a post-doctoral fellow in Sambles' research group who continued working on
      grating aligned liquid crystals to augment the work being done within
      DERA. With EPSRC and MOD funding [3.4, 3.5], Wood and others went on to
      explore the azimuthal anchoring energies in a range of diffraction grating
      structures [3.6]. Exeter also developed rigorous theoretical models used
      to deduce the configuration of the liquid crystal close to the grating
      surface [3.7]. DERA filed a number of primary patents centred on aligning
      liquid crystals with gratings, the most important of which was the
      Zenithal Bistable Device (ZBD) [3.8]. This device broke new ground as it
      resulted in two optically distinct stable states at zero power, one
      appearing dark under crossed polarisers, and the other, light. Power is
      only required to switch between these states.
    In 1996, Wood moved to DERA and a total of 11 patents were filed, with

    The Director of the UK's ISIS Neutron Facility has said: `While the
        term `world leading' is over-used
        ... the OU-ISIS technique developments have been leading the world. And
        within the resulting
        research outcomes there continue to be numerous examples that have
        significant technical and
        financial impact on industry' [5.1].
    The ability for industry to undertake reliable, accurate and speedy
      non-destructive residual stress
      measurements has two essential requirements suitable hardware
      (instrumentation) and effective
      experimental methods. Open University research has delivered solutions
      that satisfy both of these
      requirements.
    The OU led the consortium to design and build the &amp;#163;3.5m ENGIN-X
      instrument [3.1] at ISIS which
      was the world's first dedicated engineering neutron diffractometer. It was
      designed to measure
      large, intact, industrial components so that companies would have directly
      relevant data for the
      solution of their problems. Since 2011, the impact of this instrument on
      industry has increased, with
      beamtime being awarded directly to UK-based companies through the
      ICR&amp;amp;D (Industrial
      Collaborative R&amp;amp;D) scheme for projects demonstrating economic benefit.
      Companies that have
      benefited from this scheme include Rolls-Royce, EDF Energy, TWI, the Train
      Consortium (RSSB,
      ATOC, Lucchini, Siemens), AREVA, BorgWarner, Tata Steel, and Airbus [5.2].
    We continue to advance both hardware and experimental methods for
      residual stress
      measurement; for example our recent work on new methodologies and
      instrumentation for
      combining imaging and diffraction techniques [3.4]. The Director of ISIS
      has written: `This work has
        made major contributions that underpin both the machine design and the
        experimental
        methodology for the &amp;#163;10M IMAT instrument currently under construction at
        ISIS' [5.3].
    The impact of the OU's SScanSS optimisation and control methodology in
      terms of improving
      accuracy, reducing set-up times, enabling otherwise impractical
      measurements and offering QA to
      safety critical industrial users, such as the nuclear sector, is attested
      by its use at (currently) eight
      international facilities:
    2005: The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL, USA) provides financial
      support for further
      development
    2007: Installed at ORNL
    2010: Modified and installed at the ANSTO (Australian Nuclear Science and
      Technology
      Organisation) OPAL research reactor
    2011: Modified and installed at the DIAMOND synchrotron source (UK)
    2012: Modified and installed at the Spallation Neutron Source (USA)
    2012: Modified and installed at the FRM-II research reactor (Germany)
    2012: Modified and installed at Chalk River Laboratories research reactor
      (Canada).
    2013: Modified and installed at NECSA research reactor (South Africa).
    In summary, `It has changed the way that residual stress measurements
        using neutron diffraction
        are made worldwide.' [5.1].
    For example, the Head of the Bragg Institute, (ANSTO, Australia) writes:
      `The SScanSS software
        and associated methods are routinely used on our strain scanner
        (KOWARI), where they are an
        invaluable tool, enabling engineering residual stress measurements on
        large and complex shape
        samples from academic and industrial users such as, TWI Ltd., Pacific
        Rail Engineering Ltd.,
        Hardchrome Ltd, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
        Organisation (CSIRO),
        the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) and the Institute
        of Railway
        Technology.' [5.4].
    By improving the capacity for measuring residual stress at most of the
      world's major facilities our
      research has impacted on a large number of industrial development
      programs. For example, the
      Group Leader of the Diffraction and Thermophysical Properties Group at Oak
      Ridge National
      Laboratory describes how major industrial users such as John Deere and
      General Motors referred
      to SScanSS at a recent User meeting at Oak Ridge: `The use of the data
        and the accuracy in
        position were critical for John Deere to achieve major improvement and
        replace very expensive
        `build and test' research programs with validated computer modelling';
      and General Motors attest
      that `the use of the metrology equipment and SScanSS software were
        critical in their study [of
        hydrogen storage tubes intended for hydrogen storage in vehicle]'.
      [5.5].
    Further, referring to a multi-year study of the dissimilar metal welds
      joining the pressure vessel and
      primary coolant piping in nuclear power plant conducted by the US Electric
      Power Research
      Institute (EPRI): `without this capability [in accuracy of measurement
        location] that your code
        provided, the uncertainty in location and hence accuracy in stress would
        have been at least
        doubled and hence likely of little value. The neutron residual stress
        maps were critical to providing
        confidence limits on the best FEA models that enable EPRI and NRC to
        then predict the probability
        of failure at the critical dissimilar metal weld region. These advances
        will enable the USA nuclear
        industry to predict the likelihood of surviving any of multiple possible
        events that potentially could
        lead to catastrophic failure of an operating nuclear plant' [5.5].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Our research has enhanced neutron diffraction instruments worldwide for
      strain measurements on
      industrial engineering components, moving the technique from a scientific
      to an engineering tool.
      We led the &amp;#163;3.5m consortium which designed and built the world's first
      neutron diffractometer
      optimised for engineering measurements (ENGIN-X at the UK ISIS neutron
      source). The Strain
      Scanning Software (SScanSS) we developed for experiment visualization,
      simulation and control
      vastly improved the utility of the instrument to execute engineering
      residual stress measurements
      in complex structures and is now adopted at eight facilities worldwide.
      Numerous multinational
      companies including General Motors, John Deere, Airbus, Tata Steel and
      Pacific Rail Engineering
      have used the methods from our research to support their development
      programmes.

    1993-2004: Edwards (Senior Lecturer / Reader, left the OU 2011)
      recognised the potential
      demand for non-destructive measurements of residual stress. He was joint
      lead (with Withers,
      Cambridge) on the EU PREMIS programme that constructed the ENGIN
      diffractometer at ISIS.
      Edwards then led the consortium that designed and built the &amp;#163;3.5m ENGIN-X
      instrument, the
      world's first dedicated engineering neutron diffractometer, at ISIS. The
      new ENGIN-X instrument
      achieved a factor of 10 increase in performance over ENGIN, enabling
      production of residual strain
      data at a rate that made it a practical engineering tool [3.1].
    2001: Edwards (Reader) observed that providing an optimised and
      dedicated instrument was not
      in itself sufficient because setting up and controlling a residual stress
      experiment consumed an
      unacceptable amount of expensive beam time.
    2004-07: James (Research Fellow, appointed to permanent position
      2006) developed an
      experiment planning and automation system (SScanSS) to optimise beam-based
      research
      measurements. The SScanSS system adds a virtual model of the sample,
      derived from CAD or
      laser scanning data, to a kinematic model of the instrument to create a
      virtual laboratory. The
      virtual laboratory is integrated with the instrument and metrology
      hardware and is used to plan,
      simulate, optimise and execute residual stress measurements [3.2].
    2008-12: James (Research Fellow) introduced processed neutron and
      X-ray tomography data to
      provide an alternative source of virtual sample model for the SScanSS
      system, in addition to CAD
      or laser scan surface data, so making it possible to place diffraction
      measurements (routinely and
      automatically) on hidden internal features of a sample in order to
      identify material composition or
      residual stress [3.3, 3.4].
    2009-13: In 2007 a number of drivers led to the proposal to build
      the world's first combined
      imaging and diffraction instrument, `IMAT', at ISIS. These drivers
      included the increased use of
      imaging as an engineering tool, the continued oversubscription of ENGIN-X,
      the advent of new
      energy selective methods and the opportunity to offer the combined image
      guided diffraction
      methods described above on one instrument. James (Research Fellow)
      and Fitzpatrick
      (Professor) conducted research underpinning the new &amp;#163;10m instrument
      currently under
      construction. Comprehensive simulation of neutron optics and data
      reduction processes were
      carried out (OU) to prove the concept and to optimise components. In
      particular, OU research led
      to improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio in the instrument image data
      by redesigning the
      neutron guide [3.5].

    Approximately 7% of pre-school children have language impairments (e.g.
      Tomblin et al., 1997), which translates to about 40,000 children who are
      starting school in the U.K. each year, with over 5,000 of these children
      having severe and complex speech and language difficulties (Bercow, 2008).
      The ability to communicate underpins children's social, emotional and
      educational development, and those who do not benefit from early
      intervention are at increased risk of educational underachievement,
      emotional and behavioural problems, and poorer employment prospects
      (Bercow, 2008). It is therefore, essential, that appropriate tools exist
      to identify and diagnose specific speech and language difficulties in
      early childhood and to monitor the effects of intervention. The
      international reputation of the University of Reading team's research on
      typical and atypical language development [1], led to an invitation to
      enter a competitive tender to produce a new language test using the brand
      name Reynell (an author of an earlier language test) with the
      publishers NFER-Nelson, a leader in the fields of health and education.
      The team's successful bid led NFER-Nelson to commission the piloting and
      standardisation of the test and a reliable assessment tool was
      subsequently produced for use in clinical practice. The test was unique in
      that it included measures to assess the acquisition of key components of
      linguistic structure, reflected advances in understanding the development
      of child language (based on the team's underpinning research), tested both
      comprehension and expression, was developed in the U.K. and provided
      reliable norms of young children's language based on a large
      representative sample of children from the U.K. and Republic of Ireland.
      Prior to the development of this test, Speech and Language Therapists
      (SLTs) in the U.K. and Republic of Ireland did not have access to an
      assessment that provided robust normative scores for both language
      comprehension and expression to guide clinical decision making [2]. The
      test also provided clinicians with a standard for monitoring the
      effectiveness of educational or medical intervention or building profiles
      of specific clinical populations. Thus, the publication of a valid,
      standardised test of language development contributed to language
      assessment of children, improved diagnosis, enabled clinicians to target
      intervention, provided a means of calibrating effectiveness, and provided
      a reliable tool for researchers measuring language change [2].
    Members of the research team (Susan Edwards and Carolyn Letts) led
      workshops across the U.K. for health and education workers to promote the
      test and offer training for potential users on the purpose and
      administration of the test scales. Furthermore, the team were invited to
      author a lead article for the journal of the Royal College of Speech and
      Language Therapists, the Journal of Language and Communication
        Disorders, and the authors gave presentations and workshops at
      professional meetings in Norway, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Greece,
      Germany, Canada, Hong Kong, Iran, Kuwait and the U.S.A.
    The beneficiaries of this work have been children with language
      impairment, their parents, clinicians (SLTs and related professionals),
      and health and education authorities. Wide and varied use of the test is
      indicated by the large number of publications that cite the test within
      clinical contexts [3], including evaluation of interventions for young
      children who stammer, and also children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
      Other populations where the test has been used include children with
      Down's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder, developmental delay,
      hearing impairments, cochlear implants, and also children on the autistic
      spectrum [4].
    In line with the expansion of evidence-based interventions for language
      impairment and associated conditions in the NHS, and in response to
      demands for SLTs to provide scores from robust language testing during
      legal proceedings, SLTs are increasingly required to justify their
      diagnoses and demonstrate effectiveness to their funders (educational
      and/or health authorities). The robust underpinning research and
      psychometric properties of the test have, therefore, made it the test of
      choice for SLTs and related professionals [2] and this preference is
      reflected in the high volume of sales of the test [5]. Since its
      publication 5,259 copies of the RDLS3 have been sold. As a test record
      form is required for each administration of the test it is notable that
      371,835 RDLS3 record forms have been sold (in addition to the 25 forms
      that come with each test kit) giving a clearer illustration of the number
      of children who have actually been tested. Despite tests sold prior to the
      REF period still being in use, sales have continued to be high in the U.K.
      and increasingly overseas during the REF period. Since 2008, 20,845
      additional record forms have been sold, with about a third of these sold
      overseas (6,080). In fact most of the tests that been sold during the REF
      period have been to overseas users (301 of 329 tests) [5]. The test has
      also been translated for use by overseas clinicians (it is now available
      in, e.g. Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch and Malay) and it has also been used
      within clinical research in countries including Sweden and Israel [6],
      providing a resource for language assessment and diagnosis for children
      with language impairments with substantial international reach.
    As a result of the success of the RDLS3, in 2008 Susan Edwards (with
      Carolyn Letts (now at Newcastle University) and Indra Sinka (now at Open
      University)) were commissioned by Granada Learning (GL) Assessment
      (&amp;#163;300,000) to develop a new, re-standardised edition of the test, the New
      Reynell Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS; published 2011 [1]). Sales
      of this new test have already reached 650 tests (plus a further 5,375
      record forms), with 105 tests being sold in the EU and 163 in other parts
      of the world. The substantial ongoing sales of the record forms and the
      commissioning of a revised version of the test are testament to its
      outstanding reputation and enduring legacy.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Language impairment is common in children and, without effective early
      intervention, presents a risk for educational, social and emotional
      disturbance. The team used their considerable experience in child language
      research to produce a novel assessment of child language development &amp;#8212; The
      Reynell Developmental Language Scales 3 (RDLS3) &amp;#8212; the first test of child
      language development to be standardised in the U.K. to assess both
      understanding and production of language in young children. Use of the
      test has improved language assessment and diagnosis for children with
      language impairments and, as such, has enabled health and education
      professionals to target therapy and monitor the effectiveness of
      interventions to improve child language development. The test has been
      widely used in the U.K. and is now also being used widely internationally.
      Recent research by the team has informed a revised version of the test &amp;#8212;
      The New Reynell Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS). Sales figures of
      the RDLS3 and the commissioning of the NRDLS are testament to its
      outstanding reputation and enduring legacy worldwide.

    The impact was underpinned by two phases of research conducted by members
      of the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences at the
      University of Reading.
    Prior to the REF period, research by the team included (i) the
      construction of a developmental profile of lexical and grammatical
      development in preschool children (Crystal, Fletcher &amp;amp; Garman, 1989;
      Edwards et al., 1992); and (ii) grammatical analyses of the spoken
      language in individuals at risk from language impairment, identifying
      difficulties in the use of auxiliary verbs and verb inflections among
      children with language impairment (Fletcher &amp;amp; Peters, 1984), and
      limitations on temporal adverbial usage in these children (Fletcher and
      Garman, 1988). This research highlighted a number of key features to be
      included in the test in order to provide a thorough, developmentally
      sensitive assessment of language development in children, including the
      comprehension and expression of both single words and increasingly complex
      grammatical structures. Accordingly, targets for assessment were selected
      and procedures created to measure language development in children from
      1.5 to 7 years of age.
    The first phase of research within the REF period involved the piloting
      of assessment procedures and standardisation of the RDLS3 language
      development test between 1995 and 1997. Clinicians working with language
      impaired children were consulted in order to identify the assessment
      procedures that were most effective and informative about a child's
      understanding and production of key language features. Early versions of
      the RDLS3 were trialled on 400 typically developing children and the most
      discriminating measurement items were selected for the final version.
      Validation and standardisation of the test was then conducted using a
      cohort of 1,074 typically developing children recruited from a wide range
      of socio-economic backgrounds and geographical locations within the UK and
      the Republic of Ireland (1, 2). On the basis of this research a
      comprehensive test of child language based on developmental norms (the
      RDLS3) was published in 1997. The publication included instructions,
      examples, case studies, technical details and user friendly tables giving
      percentiles, standard scores and age equivalents for typically developing
      children between 1.5 and 7 years of age. All metrics were based on a large
      representative sample of children from the U.K. and Republic of Ireland
      (1, 2).
    The second phase has involved language development research conducted
      within the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences since the
      publication of the RDLS3 and has contributed to a further revision of the
      test (the New Reynell Developmental Language Scale or NRDLS, 2011; 3).
      Specifically, the development of the test was influenced by normative data
      for vocabulary development based on work by Schafer in the Reading team
      with colleagues at the University of Oxford (4). The recent revision of
      the test includes specific considerations for assessing multilingual
      children, influenced by research at the University of Reading describing
      patterns of language delay among children where English is not their
      primary language (5, 6). On the basis of these and other new developments
      in language development research, the NRDLS was revised, piloted and then
      standardised with 1,266 typically developing children aged 2 to 7.5 years
      (3, 7, 8). The NRDLS was published in 2011 and provides instructions,
      examples, case studies, technical details and user friendly tables giving
      percentiles, standard scores and age equivalents for typically developing
      children between 2 and 7.5 years of age based on a large representative
      sample of English children.

    Through the longstanding interaction with AVX Ltd the company was aware
      of our unique academic research involving FIB micromachining allied to
      microscopy of ferroelectrics to reveal intrinsic behaviour and identify
      consequences of defects to capacitor behaviour.
    In 2011, AVX Ltd encountered a reliability problem concerning specific
      MLCC product ranges. Through their Tier 2 customers Lear Corporation and
      Johnson Controls Inc. who on behalf of their Tier 1 customer Volkswagen
      Group (for VW and Audi) reported that the Volkswagen Group had revised the
      environmental specification for MLCC (case sizes 0603 and 0805) for
      automotive applications [Source 1].
    Under revised environmental stress conditions at the customer site and
      subsequently replicated in the AVX Ltd. factory, of increased humidity and
      temperature, the supplied parts where exhibiting unacceptable failure
      rates. "The automotive industry is one of the most demanding markets
        for MLCC with failure rates often pushed toward no more than 1:109
      parts" [Source 1]. This arises because both the owner and
      the public on the road perceives particular brand of vehicle to have
      broken down and to not associate the breakdown with failure of a supply
      chain component.
    AVX Ltd made available a selection of operational and failed parts for
      our investigation along with a technical brief on their electrical testing
      to date on the basis that they "... were aware of the research in
        ceramic capacitors and in particular the innovative focused ion beam
        methods applied to ferroelectrics and capacitors that had been developed
        at Queen's" [Source 1].
    With our previous research in more sensitive nanoscale capacitors allied
      to our expertise acquired via the KTP project "handling `green' and
        finished parts" we were familiar at handling their commercial
      product and that was seen as `beneficial" [Source 1].
    A MLCC is comprised of a stack of several hundred interleaved
      ferroelectric ceramic and nickel electrode layers. Electric contact to the
      device is then made via end terminations of two layers of nickel and tin.
      The tin layer provides the region for solder contact to be made. In the
      particular product that exhibited failure the electrode is connected to
      the MLCC via a stress relieving silver-polymer composite layer.
    We were able to adapt and formulate a modification to our usual FIB based
      micromachining protocols used in the creation of nanoscale capacitors to
      develop a workflow that would allow us to extract representative sample
      pieces for evaluation and inspection. This adapted workflow meant that we
      were able to perform successional slicing of the MLCC's in a series of
      testing locations.
    Electron microscopy imaging and associated chemical analysis was
      performed on slices extracted and in regions from where they had been
      removed. It became evident that the failure under humidity test was not
      arising from damage to or degradation of the more sensitive ferroelectric
      ceramic material, but instead it was originating at the interface of the
      electrode layers and the ferroelectric ceramic.
    A major challenge, over the last fifteen or so years, in all research and
      engineering of ferroelectric capacitors has been the move away from noble
      metal electrodes and contacts to base metals such as nickel. Nickel will
      unfavourably oxidise at the interface with the oxide-based titanate
      ferroelectric. In this case of these failed parts further detailed
      examination on FIB machined sections led to an unexpected cause of the
      actual device failure. The final overcoat of tin was introducing
      additional stress due to a high deposition rate that was exacerbating the
      delamination of the nickel from the ferroelectric. That delamination then
      provided a path for the metal in the polymer composite to escape under
      application of voltage and caused part failure.
    A report [Source 2] of the investigation and outcomes was prepared
      and a de-briefing meeting at AVX Ltd arranged and the findings presented.
      In addition to the technical staff of AVX Ltd at Coleraine also present
      were engineers from their subsidiary plant in the Czech Republic that
      undertakes the electro-plating of the metal electrode layers.
    In addressing the reach and significance of this impact we note that
      while AVX Ltd is based in Coleraine, Northern Ireland (NI), they are part
      of AVX Corporation who are in turn part of Kyocera Electronic Devices in
      the Kyocera Group.
    As of 2012 AVX Ltd. employed 317 people in NI and had a &amp;#163;108M turnover;
      no profit figures are available [Source 3]. The factory operates a
      subsidiary activity in the Czech Republic. Product development and
      principal manufacture in undertaken in Coleraine and then the parts are
      shipped to the Czech Republic for the plating and sample testing before
      supply to customers.
    On the basis of our technical report and de-briefing meeting, informed by
      data acquired using our FIB micromachining protocols AVX Ltd were able to
      undertake timely revisions to their manufacturing program. This eradicated
      the part failures to an accepted tolerance level and thus allowed them to
      deliver on the contract to their Tier 2 customers Lear Corporation and
      Johnson Controls Inc. who then in turn supply to their Tier 1 customers VW
      and Audi [Source 1].
    AVX Ltd. have confirmed that the value of the international contract was
      "valued at $0.6M". [Source 1].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The provision of professional analysis and advice has created an economic
      impact of $0.6M with AVX Ltd, a leading supplier of electronic components
      within the Kyocera Group. This information was pivotal to AVX Ltd
      retaining a major contract, for multi-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC's)
      supply through to the automotive manufacturer Volkswagen Group. Our
      intervention addressed a reliability issue in the MLCCs and allowed them
      to improve processes and revise manufacture protocols. The impact drew on
      previous collaborative research with AVX Ltd and innovative methodologies
      for preparation of micro and nanoscale samples of materials in capacitors
      in academic research.

    In the mid-1990's, academic staff, Bowman and Gregg, initiated a research
      activity to map and understand the properties of micro- and nanoscale
      ferroelectrics. Ferroelectrics were receiving significant commercial
      interest in numerous capacitor applications/markets. A key element in the
      early research was the fabrication and functional characterisation of very
      simple thin film planar capacitor structures based on titanates. These
      were investigated in an attempt to elucidate fundamental reasons for the
      dramatic collapse in permittivity, that reduces device capacitance, with
      decreasing device thickness and which was not understood at the time [Reference
        1]. This was of great importance as titanates are of principal use
      for both commercial ceramic capacitors (circa 1012 components
      manufactured p.a.) such as the X7R devices and for novel high-K
      perovskite-based Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) systems
      conceptualised at the time.
    While capacitor structures made in-house did allow useful insights [Reference
        2], it soon became clear that ferroelectric (dielectric) properties
      were so sensitive to defects, introduced during thin film growth, that a
      radically new experimental approach was needed. Thus, from 2002, a wholly
      novel programme in which thin film capacitors were made from small slices
      of ferroelectric cut from high purity single crystals using Focused Ion
      Beam (FIB) milling [Reference 3] was initiated. Functional
      characterisation of these relatively unclamped defect-free systems
      demonstrated that the permittivity did not necessarily collapse with
      dielectric thickness decrease at all and that the effect could be
      engineered out in real devices. Such insights were published in a number
      of articles between 2004 and 2009 [Reference 4, 5].
    At the same time as this FIB micro-machining work progressed that
      included further insights into damage mitigation [Reference 6] we
      commenced a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with AVX Ltd. The
      three-year project from 2005-2007 worth &amp;#163;123K was titled "Critical
        interfaces in currently produced capacitors". The project engaged
      M.M. Saad, primary author of Reference 3, as the Knowledge Transfer
      Associate. The project combined precision micro-machining by FIB to
      isolate known and potential defects and regions of MLCCs for detailed
      chemical and structural analysis that would then be followed up via TEM
      (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and STEM (Scanning Transmission
      Electron Microscopy). In the programme the parts investigated covered X7R
      specifications for in consumer electronics applications through to those
      for high voltage automotive usage. This provided Bowman and Gregg with
      significant bilateral experience in handling of parts and establishing
      common terminological ground for the use of the research methodologies and
      results to be applied to evaluating the defects that arise in such
      commercial components.
    We note that associated research in thin film capacitors remains an
      active area of endeavour, most recently via Technology Strategy Board
      (TSB) support of a project "Advanced capacitors for energy storage"
      with Syfer Technology worth &amp;#163;164K in 2010-12 and has received significant
      recent press attention http://goo.gl/p1kp12.
      Such collaborations have tapped various aspects of the ferroelectrics
      expertise developed in Queen's, but microscopy and FIB-processing
      knowledge has been crucial in all collaborative research to date.

      was corporate realisation of the need to explore new materials, ideas and&#xD;
      fabrication methodologies. To this end in 2007-09 Seagate Technology&#xD;
      commenced restructuring of R&amp;amp;D activities in tandem with closure of&#xD;
      corporate R&amp;amp;D in Pittsburgh, USA.&#xD;
    To be competitive for corporate investment for these new technologies&#xD;
      required a set of competences that went significantly beyond that of the&#xD;
      R&amp;amp;D activity constituted at Springtown in 2009 and the risk that&#xD;
      investment would be made elsewhere was held by the regional development&#xD;
      agency, Invest NI "... our initial concern that the investment would&#xD;
        be made in USA rather than Northern Ireland." [Source 1].&#xD;
    Further, to also address the upcoming paradigm shift of heat assisted&#xD;
      magnetic recording (HAMR) whereby a read/write head would integrate a&#xD;
      light delivery system to deliver heat to a localised spot on the disk&#xD;
      which would necessitate additional expertise in plasmonic design and&#xD;
      realisation beyond that of their own early concepts (see W. Challener et&#xD;
      al, Nature Photonics 3, 220 (2009)&#xD;
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphoton.2009.26).&#xD;
    In undertaking the development of the investment business case for the&#xD;
      expansion of their R&amp;amp;D activities at Springtown, Seagate Technology&#xD;
      developed a strategy that would see the Springtown team focus on&#xD;
      Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 5-9 while simultaneously identifying&#xD;
      supporting collaborative basic research in the University [Source 2]&#xD;
      founded on an open innovation model.&#xD;
    Following horizon scanning by Seagate Springtown, a due-diligence&#xD;
      exercise evaluated our research competence as the suitable supporting&#xD;
      element to their strategy [Source 3]. Research that made material&#xD;
      contribution to the exercise was [Source 2]:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      "A capability to undertake physical creation, examination and&#xD;
          measurements on ferroic materials on a sub 100nm dimension&#xD;
      The ability to create novel ferroic and photonic architectures that&#xD;
          embody integration of traditional deposition methods such as vapor&#xD;
          deposition and electro-deposition and new the nanotechnologies such as&#xD;
          template growth and self-assembly.&#xD;
      The fabrication of nanoscale plasmonic elements in geometry and&#xD;
          integration akin to that envisaged for medium term realization of&#xD;
          HAMR.&#xD;
      The ability to undertake plasmonic design, tailored to preliminary&#xD;
          HAMR needs and realization."&#xD;
    &#xD;
    The importance of our role in the Seagate investment case was recognised&#xD;
      by Invest NI as "... a key factor in moving the discussion forward and&#xD;
        ultimately enabling the investment to be made in Northern Ireland.&#xD;
        Attracting such a large corporate investment to Northern Ireland has had&#xD;
        a hugely positive economic impact in the region.". [Source 1].&#xD;
    Management at Seagate Springtown developed their investment business case&#xD;
      that secured corporate mandate for the &amp;#163;60M investment package to grow the&#xD;
      R&amp;amp;D function, in support of the areas outlined above, by 85 persons&#xD;
      and announced in January 2010 [Source 4]. Subsequently, in June&#xD;
      2010, a further strand of the business case was an additional investment&#xD;
      of around &amp;#163;9M (capital and recurrent) by Seagate to a new open innovation&#xD;
      hub at CNM called ANSIN working in TRL 1-4 [Source 5]. This is&#xD;
      their first such venture globally.&#xD;
    The consequences of this impact have been marked. With the creation of&#xD;
      the R&amp;amp;D posts at Springtown, by 2013 the site undertakes 40% of the&#xD;
      corporate R&amp;amp;D for read/write heads, a proportion significantly greater&#xD;
      than in 2008, and has responsibility for recording heads in notebook&#xD;
      products [Source 2].&#xD;
    To describe the reach and significance of this impact, Seagate Technology&#xD;
      is the world-leading provider of data storage devices. They have the&#xD;
      broadest product offering in the industry with the largest customer base,&#xD;
      and focus on the vertical integration of the critical technologies:&#xD;
      read/write heads and recording media. Seagate has a market capitalisation&#xD;
      of $13B and 53,000 employees worldwide. It has some 43% of the storage&#xD;
      device market and revenues of $10-12B p.a. (Q2 FY13: 57M drives shipped;&#xD;
      revenue of $3.7B).&#xD;
    Of Seagate's two sites for the development and manufacture of the&#xD;
      read/write heads, Springtown has a dominant role in manufacture. The&#xD;
      operation employs around 1350 staff, with 200 OEM staff on-site, and&#xD;
      manufactures some 300-400M read/write heads p.a., supplying 75% of&#xD;
      Seagate's needs (equating to some 25-30% of the global supply). The site&#xD;
      contributes some &amp;#163;100M p.a. Gross Value Add (GVA) to the UK economy.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    University research and expertise in materials and photonics relevant to&#xD;
      data storage has influenced strategic investment decision-making within&#xD;
      Seagate Technology resulting in the creation of 85 new R&amp;amp;D positions&#xD;
      in the UK announced in 2010. These new jobs were part of an &amp;#163;60M&#xD;
      investment that saw a re-allocation of corporate budget from the USA and&#xD;
      resulted in significant expansion of Seagate Technology's UK based R&amp;amp;D&#xD;
      capacity. The investment was made to support their medium-term technology&#xD;
      roadmap plans. Seagate Technology is the world-leading manufacturer and&#xD;
      supplier of data storage technology in the form of disk drives, employing&#xD;
      53,000 people worldwide.&#xD;

    Since the late 1990's, our research has focused on the processing and&#xD;
      physics of nanoscale ferroic materials and in nano-optics and plasmonics&#xD;
      aided by the creation of tailored nanostructured materials for various&#xD;
      plasmonic implementations. Understanding and controlling the processing&#xD;
      and fabrication of nanoscale ferroic materials (e.g. ferroelectrics and&#xD;
      ferromagnetics), developing methodologies to explore ferroic domain&#xD;
      formation and switching on sub 100-nm lengths are key basic enablers for&#xD;
      future hard-disk read/write technology. Plasmonics and near field optical&#xD;
      delivery are central to the developments required for heat-assisted&#xD;
      magnetic recording (HAMR) that will be the next paradigm in data storage.&#xD;
    By 2009 a culmination and expression of underpinning research was&#xD;
      exemplified by:&#xD;
    Meso and Nanoscale Ferroics&#xD;
    We established a globally unique activity in which thin film and&#xD;
      nanoscale effects were probed in lamellae, wires and dots cut directly&#xD;
      from bulk single crystal material using a Focused Ion Beam (FIB)&#xD;
      Microscope [Reference 1]. Thus intrinsic effects of nanoscale patterning&#xD;
      geometry on switching behaviour can be studied and related to that being&#xD;
      seen in ferromagnetic systems. With our alumina template self-assembly we&#xD;
      demonstrated the close integration of ferroic materials and noble metals&#xD;
      to make ultra-high density memory demonstrators (at almost 1Tb/inch2)&#xD;
      [Reference 2].&#xD;
    Plasmonics and Nanowires&#xD;
    Alumina templates and self-assembly has also seen the realisation of&#xD;
      metallic nanowire and nanotube arrays that have been specifically tailored&#xD;
      to generate new and exciting plasmon-mediated optical properties&#xD;
      [Reference 3]. Of note is the extreme sensitivity of the nanowire&#xD;
      absorption properties to the nature of the wire-surface interface and&#xD;
      means the arrays show great potential for novel plasmonic transducers&#xD;
      [Reference 4] to be exploited via a spinout company, Causeway Sensors,&#xD;
      formed in 2013.&#xD;
    This research provided underpinning relevance to Seagate Technology's&#xD;
      medium-term technology roadmap plans in three unique ways:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      We (Bowman, Gregg, Pollard) demonstrated the integration of nanoscale&#xD;
        noble metals and ferroic materials (magnetic elements and ferroelectric&#xD;
        elements layers) into alumina creating electrical and optically&#xD;
        functional devices on the sub 100nm length scale [Reference 2 and 4].&#xD;
        This is attractive when considering future integration of photonic&#xD;
        elements into conventional ferroic devices such as a read/write head;&#xD;
      We (Pollard &amp;amp; Zayats (to 2011)) demonstrated how the shape of&#xD;
        plasmonic elements leads to particular optical response [Reference 5].&#xD;
        This is attractive when considering realisation of a plasmonic radiating&#xD;
        element for HAMR;&#xD;
      We (Zayats (to 2011)) demonstrated through simulation how material&#xD;
        shaping can be used to create plasmonic waveguide elements [Reference&#xD;
        6]. This is attractive in demonstrating a light delivery system within a&#xD;
        read/write head. This work was undertaken in collaboration and&#xD;
        co-authored with Seagate Technology and via their financial support of&#xD;
        two PhD students on a &amp;#163;80k grant (2005-08) held by Bowman.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    This was augmented further because the research programmes undertaken&#xD;
      since 2003 had been facilitated by &amp;#163;3M capital infrastructural investment&#xD;
      made by Invest NI (see acknowledgements in References 1, 2, 3 and 5)&#xD;
      creating an environment commensurate with what is required for high level&#xD;
      industrial engagement supporting other relationships e.g. via three&#xD;
      Knowledge Transfer Partnerships.&#xD;

    In contrast to many arts and humanities research projects, in which
      impact is undertaken after research conclusions have been reached,
      Sullivan embedded cross-sector impact activity into the research process
      of `Shakespeare's Global Communities'. This meant that engagement and
      interaction with stakeholders beyond traditional academic boundaries
      became a crucial part of the project's data collection and analysis.
    Facilitating public debate
    Working closely with Dr Edmondson and the SBT, the world's leading
      charity in promoting the works, life, and times of Shakespeare,
      significantly expanded the wider reach of the project. By embedding www.yearofshakespeare.com
      within the SBT's existing BloggingShakespeare.com
      digital platform, the project team was able to link the site to the over
      1,500 readers already subscribed to the SBT's RSS blog feed and the over
      5,000 followers of the SBT on Twitter and Facebook. Sullivan, Prescott,
      and Edmondson also worked with the SBT's digital partner, Misfit, Inc.
	  (misfit-inc.com), a company with
      extensive experience in social media campaigns, to produce an interactive
      and media-rich digital space that would appeal to users beyond academia.
    The appeal of the site was reflected in the reception it received. www.yearofshakespeare.com
      launched on April 23rd 2012, Shakespeare's 448th
      birthday, and by the close of the project on November 15th 2012
      the homepage and the site's 131 reviews and blog posts had received more
      than 37,615 hits from users in ninety-one different countries spread
      across six continents, meaning that in total www.yearofshakespeare.com
      averaged over 5,500 visits for each month of the World Shakespeare
      Festival. The site averaged 20 production reviews and blog posts per month
      (one for each working day), written not only by the established research
      network but also by readers from across the world who became involved in
      the online discussion concerning Shakespeare, the Olympics, and global
      culture (see source 1 below). High-profile readers &amp;#8212; including:
      representatives from the Edinburgh International Festival; the actor and
      author Ben Crystal; and The Guardian theatre reviewer Andrew
      Dickson &amp;#8212; featured the project in their Twitter feeds, commenting that it
      was `full of gems &amp;amp; well worth excavation'. Professor Stanley Wells
      drew further attention to the project in his article on the World
      Shakespeare Festival for The Stage, a weekly theatre publication
      with a circulation of approximately 34,000 copies per week (source 2).
    Very significantly, the critical record created includes a wide range of
      voices and opinions. Alongside the reviews and blogs posted in the site
      are over 270 reader comments; over 60 audio and video interviews with
      Festival audience members, including ones given in British Sign Language;
      and over 200 Twitter, Facebook, and blog reactions to productions linked
      together through threads in Storify, which is a social media tool that
      lets users create timelines or stories from diverse media content (source
      1).
    The plurality of this online discussion brought increased attention to
      the multiple ways in which cultural value is constructed for different
      user groups, illustrating the complex global dynamics at work in cultural
      exchange and changing the way in which users understood Shakespeare's
      value in their own culture. In a conversation following a Swahili The
      Merry Wives of Windsor at The Globe in London, an audience member
      told our interviewer that s/he `didn't really know about Shakespeare
      before' and that `it was nice to see a Swahili play in London' (source 3
      below). Likewise, in a response to a review of a Nigerian production of The
      Winter's Tale, one reader described the pride she felt at seeing her
      diasporic community represented at The Globe: `It was an amazing night. As
      an early thirties Yoruba girl, it was glorious to see so many of my
      contemporaries in the audience and loving the interaction between so many
      different generations.' In response to a blog post about the Olympics
      Opening Ceremony, several readers debated the cultural significance of the
      speech from The Tempest that was used to open the show, noting in
      particular its colonial themes: `The context of the play provides a
      relevant symbolism, as topical today as any other time', one reader wrote.
      `[I w]onder if the Olympic creative team meant it.' Such exchanges
      revealed the multifaceted reactions audiences were having to the World
      Shakespeare Festival within the context of the global Olympic Games,
      leading one reader, who later became a project blogger, to comment,
      `What's most important [about the WSF] is that the questions around
      Shakespeare are making an impact beyond Shakespeare.'
    Preserving heritage and influencing practice
    While other arts and culture websites attempted to cover as many of the
      Festival's productions and events as possible &amp;#8212; most notably The
      Guardian and The Arts Desk &amp;#8212; the geographic and temporal
      scope of the Festival made this a considerable challenge (productions
      occurred not just in London and Stratford-upon-Avon but also South Wales,
      Newcastle, and Edinburgh). In the end, www.yearofshakespeare.com
      was the only site to document and debate all of the Festival's 74
      productions and events, meaning that it has become the only complete
      critical record available of Shakespeare's presence in the Olympic
      celebrations. The record remains open for contribution until 23 April
      2014, at which time the SBT, which manages the official archives for the
      RSC, will create a trusted digital repository of all the content and
      archive it in perpetuity in their collections, which are freely accessible
      to the public. This means that this complete record of the Festival has
      been created not only for the present moment, but also for the future.
    Edmondson describes the project as a time capsule full of messages to
      future generations, and the SBT's Collections Archivist has likewise
      emphasised how the project `provides a new opportunity for theatre
      audiences to have their voices preserved', since `historically, the
      "public voice" has been supplied only via published reviews'. Such an
      ambition has also challenged the SBT, a major UK heritage centre, to work
      with project members to create new ways of preserving culture digitally:
      `The project has allowed the SBT to develop a methodology for preserving
      such online content, and we have learnt lessons around rights clearance
      and the need for a prompt workflow to capture data in the (often
      ephemeral) online environment. The archive is now better equipped to
      capture and preserve output in this increasingly important area of digital
      documentary heritage' (source 4).
    In addition to helping shape new archival practices, the project has also
      influenced thinking in the creative sector. In its emphasis on the
      cultivation of dialogue surrounding arts events (and in particular those
      drawing on public funding), the project included arts administrators,
      educators, actors, and directors in its conversations online. The open
      format of the collaborative blog allowed artists involved in the Festival
      to `write back' to the reviewer if they wanted to add a different point of
      view. Jackson Doran, an actor from the American Q Brothers' hip-hop
      production of Othello, participated in the online debate,
      explaining how the `truncated' rehearsal period for the show led to some
      of the artistic choices commented on in the project's review of it, as
      well as thanking the reviewer for offering an `insightful' analysis and
      `thinking about [the show] in a way I think it needs to be thought about'.
      Likewise, Tim Crouch, director of the Julius Caesar-inspired I,
      Cinna (The Poet), responded to the reviewer's discussion of the
      educational elements embedded in the show, offering his own account of his
      artistic and educational objectives. He concluded by acknowledging the
      importance of debate in these matters: `Thanks for giving me this chance
      to write these things down!', a statement that highlighted the relative
      lack of dialogue usually available between theatre practitioners,
      academics, and the wider public.
    On a broader scale, key WSF and Cultural Olympiad producers have taken
      note of the project. Ruth Mackenzie, Director of the London 2012 Festival,
      requested a copy of the final project report to help aid her own
      reflection and self-evaluation, and copies were also given to Deborah Shaw
      and Tom Bird, producers of the Festival at the RSC and Globe,
      respectively. This two-way exchange of professional work marks a shift in
      the way academics working on Shakespeare in performance and theatre
      practitioners creating Shakespeare in performance interact with and learn
      from one another.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    This project created a new space for public debate surrounding the World
      Shakespeare Festival, which was a key strand in the UK's 2012 Cultural
      Olympiad. By creating a collaborative online forum that invited cultural
      conversation, the project facilitated discussion about the role of
      Shakespeare and the arts in twenty-first century culture as well as
      generating the only complete, critical, and publicly-accessible account of
      the largest intercultural celebration of Shakespeare ever staged. The
      project is an examplar of interdependent research and impact.

    In the last decade the Shakespeare Institute (SI), a postgraduate
      research centre that is part of the University of Birmingham, has become
      an international leader in the field of Shakespeare, cultural value, and
      publicly-funded arts in the 21st century. Initial research by
      Professor Kathleen E. McLuskie led to the award of a major grant from the
      AHRC in 2006 for the project `Interrogating Cultural Value in the 21st
      Century: The Case of Shakespeare', leading to the appointment of Dr Kate
      Rumbold as Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, the recruitment of two PhD
      researchers, and the forthcoming (January 2014) publication of the
      monograph Valuing Shakespeare in 21st-Century England
      with Manchester University Press.
    While the project focused specifically on the UK context, research
      undertaken for it repeatedly pointed to the global dimensions of
      Shakespeare as a figure of cultural value, leading to a University
      strategic appointment in the field of Global Shakespeare Studies. Dr
      Sullivan was appointed to this position in 2010 and charged with working
      alongside the cultural value research team to develop the international
      reach of the project. Building on her existing research into
      `anti-Bardolatry', cultural studies, and identity formation, Sullivan won
      a further AHRC award under the Connected Communities theme to research the
      Shakespeare-related events in the 2012 London Olympic celebrations and
      their valuation among global audiences. One of the major innovations of
      this project, entitled `Shakespeare's Global Communities: A Research
      Review of the World Shakespeare Festival', was to embed impact-related
      activities within the research process, and in doing so to help answer the
      central research question, `What does the World Shakespeare Festival
      reveal about Shakespeare's status as a site for intercultural community
      building and value creation in the twenty-first century?'
    The central manifestation of the research project was a professionally
      produced, multi-user digital platform called www.yearofshakespeare.com,
      which was open to diverse communities of practice for cultural debate
      about the World Shakespeare Festival and its related events (more of which
      in section 4). In order to maximize the quality and reach of the platform,
      Sullivan (the project's principal investigator) invited Dr Paul Prescott
      of the University of Warwick and Dr Paul Edmondson of The Shakespeare
      Birthplace Trust (SBT) to join as co-investigator and cultural partner.
      Prescott brought to the project expertise in modes of theatre reviewing,
      in particular theatre blogging and digital reception, and Edmondson
      brought expertise from digital outreach undertaken in the heritage sector.
    Together this core team assembled a research network of academics,
      theatre practitioners, and heritage specialists with expertise in Global
      Shakespeare studies, digital humanities, appropriation studies, and civic
      Shakespeare to contribute to the platform and to discuss reactions voiced
      within it as well as within the wider press coverage related to the 2012
      Olympics. University of Birmingham network members included all of the
      cultural value researchers mentioned above, as well as Digital Research
      Fellow David Hopes and Shakespeare Institute Director Professor Michael
      Dobson, whose work on amateur Shakespeare directly influenced programming
      in the `Open Stages' part of the World Shakespeare Festival. Other members
      came from higher education institutions across the UK as well as key
      cultural institutions including the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust Museums
      and Collections, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and Shakespeare's Globe.
    Members of the research network interacted with one another through the
      digital platform and also met for two research workshops organized by
      Sullivan, the first in London in June 2012 and the second in
      Stratford-upon-Avon in September 2012. These workshops allowed researchers
      to begin to pool cross-sector responses to the Festival and to start
      identifying emerging themes in the research process, including tensions
      between modes of regional, national, and international celebration; the
      relationship between cultural value, capital, and hegemony; and the
      challenges that both digital and non-Anglophone communication pose to
      established loci of authority. Shakespeare-related productions and events,
      the research team found, played an active role within each of these
      debates, and as such offered an important case study of how the arts and
      humanities are mobilized to participate in global performances of national
      power and influence.
    A full documentary account of the Festival has now been published by
      Bloomsbury in A Year of Shakespeare: Re-living the World Shakespeare
        Festival, edited by Sullivan and her co-investigators. Unlike most
      academic books, the collection is being marketed to a trade readership and
      has been praised by Dame Margaret Drabble as `Shakespeare criticism as you
      have never encountered it before ... It takes Shakespeare from the stage
      and academe into the age of Twitter and Facebook and makes you feel you
      were there, present at all those strange and wonderful productions you
      missed.' The book was released on 11 April 2013 and in the first 10 weeks
      it has already sold 665 copies worldwide (a considerable feat given that
      many academic print runs in the field are set at 500 copies total). A
      second collection, focusing in more detail on the critical issues raised
      during the two workshops, will be published with Bloomsbury in 2014.

    The impact of this research has been to enable food manufacturers to
      develop and market a greatly-expanded range of low fat foods, contributing
      to measures to reduce fat consumption as well as generating substantial
      sales and profits in this key economic sector.
    The findings from research carried out a Birmingham has fed directly into
      the investment in novel manufacturing processes and new low-fat food
      products by global companies including Unilever5.1,5.2,
      PepsiCo5.3, and Cargill5.1,5.4.
      Researchers at Birmingham have worked closely with these and other
      companies in long-term partnerships to maximise the impact from their
      research findings. The particular contribution of Birmingham's Chemical
      Engineering research to the economic success of the UK's food and drink
      sector was highlighted in 2010 in an independent report by Oxford
      Economics: this report used Norton's research as its leading example of
      chemistry's contribution to the industry and described the work as
      providing "a useful illustration of the beneficial impact of chemistry
        research on the food supply chain." 5.5
    This case study demonstrates one key strand of this work: the importance
      of Birmingham's research in enabling global food companies to address the
      specific challenge of producing volume-sales food products that have low
      or zero fat content whilst retaining the taste and texture required by
      consumers.
    "...the food industry is global and highly competitive. This group has
      international recognition of its research. This is attracting inward
      investment to the UK. One of the clear targets for Impact"
    [text removed for publication] Chairman IFR, former Chief Scientist,
      Unilever5.1
    Reach and significance. The take-up of this research by major
      companies has led to wide reach. Independent research published in 2011
      identified Unilever and Kraft Foods as two of the four companies most
      frequently cited as driving innovation within the areas of fat reduction
      and replacement. This research also showed the importance of the issue for
      new developments in food products, with 8.6% of new food and non-alcoholic
      drink products launched worldwide in 2008-10 making "reduced fat claims"
      and the proportion reaching 18.9% in North America5.6.
      Many of the products identified in the table are examples of this
      including; Promise, Linera, Flora light.
    The significance of the work for the collaborating industries has been
      their ability to innovate in the area and launch new products, see
      supporting letters from Unilever5.2 and PepsiCo5.3.
    The link between diet, obesity and ill-health is well-established and
      forms a major element of public health advice in the UK and elsewhere5.7.
      The wider availability of attractive low-fat options in a growing range of
      everyday foods has helped consumers follow this guidance.
    There is evidence that this is taken seriously by consumers; for
      instance, survey results included in Defra's most recent annual summary of
      food-related data reported that nutritional content is widely influential
      on shoppers' purchase decisions, particularly the level of fat within the
      food at 33% of shoppers, and that of people asked about what they were
      doing to obtain or maintain a healthy lifestyle, 38% said they were eating
      low fat versions of food (the third most frequent response5.8).
      In a broader sense, these measures bring benefits for society as a whole
      through helping reduce the incidence and health-related costs of obesity,
      acknowledged to be a widespread and serious issue.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The impact presented is the use of research carried out in the School of
      Chemical Engineering by a range of multinational food industries (inc.
      Unilever, Cargill, PepsiCo) to engineer a series of fat-reduced foods
      such as low fat spreads (LFS), dressings, margarine, sauces and
      mayonnaise. This has allowed them to build up a portfolio of novel low fat
      products; this portfolio would be much reduced or in some cases
      non-existent without the research contribution and capability generated by
      the Birmingham group as stated by Peter Lillford5.1 (former
      Chief Scientist, Unilever) and John Casey, (Vice President Biological
      Sciences, Unilever)5.2. These products are a significant and
      growing market segment e.g. LFS now outsell margarine/butter in a number
      of countries and are estimated to be worth globally 10 Billion Euros per
      year between 2008-13. Thus these products are having a significant impact
      on the industries' profitability. In addition, consumption of low fat
      foods act to tackle obesity with knock on effects for government (health
      service, lost GDP etc.) and the community as a whole.

    Novel low fat food products leading to improved health and new market

    Research on designed soft solid microstructures has been carried out in
      Chemical Engineering at University of Birmingham since 1995 and is now led
      by Ian Norton (Professor of Chemical Engineering since July 2006).
    The underpinning science is microstructure engineering of soft solid
      microstructure for food use. An example is a fundamental mechanistic
      understanding of emulsion behaviour in flow allowing control of the local
      physics in order to use phase inversion in the production of fat
      continuous products with as little as 10% fat phase. In order to do this
      the industry required detailed understanding of the role of the
      structuring agents and the kinetics of phase changes in the processes.
      This knowledge allowed process engineers to position crystals at the
      interface and thus to control droplet breakup and re-coalescence. The
      crystal position in the interface of droplets (Pickering emulsions) makes
      them inherently more stable on storage but can enhance coalescence in flow
      thus allowing the food manufacturer to economically produce stable fat
      continuous emulsions at fat contents which would inherently be more stable
      if water continuous (&amp;gt; 50% water). These structures are kinetically
      trapped as a result of the crystals in the interface, which can then be
      used to trigger flavour release and give the desired oral properties on
      consumption.
    An additional key aspect was the research carried out to control the
      relative viscosities of the two phases in emulsion products. As the oil's
      viscosity is fixed (edible triglyceride oils) this required research on
      the use of hydrocolloid physical chemistry to structure the aqueous phase
      during processing. This is a complex issue as the hydrocolloids also
      impact on sensory properties of the final product. The research was thus
      aimed to control both in process and on consumption parameters separately.
    In summary, the research carried out at the University allowed the
      industry to induce a self-catalytic inversion process by controlling and
      manipulating crystals at the oil/water interface. Because of this research
      inversion now becomes temperature controlled (not time controlled)
      allowing rapid inversion (the process runs at 10 tonnes/hour resulting in
      short residence times requiring control and manipulation of the kinetics
      of the material phase changes) and continuous production of low and very
      low fat spreads. This work was originally carried out by Prof. Pacek (at
      the time a PDRA, a Professor since 2006) who supervised Nixon3.1
      (PhD student) in the early to mid 90's and has been continued by Norton's
      group also with Dr Cox (PDRA 2006-2009, lecturer 2009-), and Dr
      Spyropoulos (PhD 2003-2006, PDRA 2006-2010 now lecturer 2010-)
    The mechanistic understanding of the use of physical structuring of the
      aqueous phase to reduce coalescence rates in the process (a processing
      aid) and to produce small water droplets that give favourable organoleptic
      response due to control and manipulation of material breakdown rates; was
      carried out by Spyropoulos and Ding (PDRA) in Pacek's group from 2003-2007
      and sponsored by Unilever3.2 (Bettina Wolf).
    This original work was then supplemented by further investigations at the
      University into phase separating biopolymer systems and how these can be
      controlled via the process conditions. Again the work carried out at the
      University into aqueous/aqueous two phase systems led to the ability to
      produce zero fat spreads (products marketed in the USA and UK) which are
      stable on storage and breakdown when consumed to give the physical
      properties and flavour release expected from margarine. This has been
      carried out by Spyropoulos3.3 since 2007.
    The second spin off was into what is now called fluid gels3.4.
      This is where the structuring of hydrocolloids is carried out in different
      flow regimes. The forming network is then constrained by the flow profile
      and gel is formed on a micro scale. The particles thus formed have the
      properties of the bulk gel but only over small distance scales. The
      particles formed can be manipulated by the choice of hydrocolloid type,
      the concentration and the solvent quality. If formulated in the right way
      we have shown that these particles can replace fat in emulsions.
    The researchers are now developing the science for a number of other
      areas &amp;#8212; including patented technology for chocolate involving Prof. Fryer
      and Jennifer Norton3.5 (PhD student 2007-2010), patented
      technology for Bakery fats, low fat snacks for Pepsi, Safa reduced bakery
      systems etc. This has taken the area of Pickering emulsions to the next
      level of complexity, involving understanding of surface crystallisation
      and crystal growth, engineering of crystallisation process and physics of
      particles at interfaces. Additionally the University has funding to
      understand duplex emulsions &amp;#8212; based on the physical chemistry and
      microstructure of shell formation around droplets. This has been carried
      out by Norton and Sarah Frasch-Melnik3.6 (PhD student
      2007-2010).

    Impact 1: Worldwide Pharmaceutical Industry&#xD;
      As a consequence of the underpinning research by Professors Baker and&#xD;
      Hill, and others, in 2003 that identified "dual efficacy" ligands at&#xD;
      different GPCRs, the novel pharmacological concept &amp;#8212; that drugs acting at&#xD;
      the same GPCR could selectively influence different downstream&#xD;
      signalling pathways &amp;#8212; became accepted worldwide by the academic and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical communities. This led to the major pharmaceutical companies&#xD;
      screening compounds in parallel for G-protein mediated and G-protein&#xD;
      independent signallingA, in particular via &amp;#946;-arrestin&#xD;
      proteins, in order to identify pathway-selective GPCR drug candidates. It&#xD;
      also led to the establishment of speciality `biased ligand' drug discovery&#xD;
      companies, e.g. Trevena Inc (www.trevenainc.com)&#xD;
      founded in 2008, seeking biased ligands to avoid signalling pathways that&#xD;
      lead to detrimental side effectsB. Indeed, the first such&#xD;
      `pathway-biased' ligands have reached clinical trials (SM DeWire &amp;amp; JD&#xD;
      Violin (2011) Circ Res 109, 205-16).&#xD;
    Impact 2: Commercial Development&#xD;
      The demand for GPCR assays that can be used to assess compound activity at&#xD;
      different G-protein- and &amp;#946;-arrestin-dependent signalling pathways has&#xD;
      generated a new market for companies to develop cell lines, reagents and&#xD;
      assay systems to facilitate this new mode of screening for drugs and&#xD;
      compounds that selectively signal through the &amp;#946;-arrestin pathway. Assay&#xD;
      platforms have been developed by DiscoveRx (&amp;#946;-arrestin PathHunterTM)D,&#xD;
      Molecular Devices (TransFluorTM)E and Life&#xD;
      Technologies (TangoTM)F. In 2005, Prof Hill's group&#xD;
      contributed to characterisation of the GPCR-&amp;#946;-arrestin assay of Applied&#xD;
      Biosystems that was based on galactosidase complementation. This was later&#xD;
      developed into the GPCR-&amp;#946;-arrestin-PathHunter screening platform5&#xD;
      by DiscoveRx using a different-sized galactosidase fragment. DiscoveRx&#xD;
      launched the PathHunter &amp;#946;-arrestin assay technology and a range of&#xD;
      &amp;#946;-arrestin-coupled GPCR cell lines, mid-2006. Their&#xD;
      &amp;#946;-arrestin-coupled GPCR cell line catalogue was expanded over the&#xD;
      following 2-3 years, and the screening technology was subsequently&#xD;
      partnered in 2009 as a 3-way allianceC with MRC Technology and&#xD;
      GSK to identify natural substances as ligands for orphan GPCRs. In&#xD;
      addition, contract research organisations such as BioFocusF&#xD;
      began to provide &amp;#946;-arrestin screening services using DiscoveRx assays&#xD;
      (introduced from 2009).&#xD;
    The G-protein-independent GPCR functional assay screening technology&#xD;
      market (specifically including &amp;#946;-arrestin assays) had already reached&#xD;
      11.5% of all GPCR functional screening assays in 2008 and continued to&#xD;
      increase over subsequent years, with DiscoveRx already taking 26% of the&#xD;
      market in 2008 (HTS-Tec, 2008)G. In 2010, the cell-based&#xD;
      screening consumables market (of which &amp;#946;-arrestin reagents are a part)&#xD;
      was estimated to be $405million, with a compound annual growth rate of 6%&#xD;
      (HTS-Tec, 2009)G. DiscoveRx had a market share of ~ 3.2%&#xD;
      (~$13million) of this worldwide cell-based screening market in 2008 &amp;#8212; of&#xD;
      which sales of GPCR &amp;#946;-arrestin screening reagents are a significant&#xD;
      proportion (HTS-Tec, 2009)G. DiscoveRx (UK) reported &amp;#163;4.2&#xD;
      million European sales revenue in 2011, an increase of nearly 40% over the&#xD;
      previous yearC. This indicates the impact of G-protein&#xD;
      independent GPCR signalling on the drug discovery and compound screening&#xD;
      market in the period from the original discovery of biased signalling in&#xD;
      2003, through the launch of the first &amp;#946;-arrestin screening reagents in&#xD;
      2006, to widespread adoption of the technology by the pharma industry from&#xD;
      2007-2008 onwards.&#xD;
    Impact 3: Healthcare Benefits&#xD;
      Drugs that operate specifically through biased signalling pathways have&#xD;
      been avidly sought by the pharma industry (e.g. Flordellis CS (2012): Curr
        Pharm Des. 18:145-60). As examples, TrevenaB&#xD;
      have: 1) an angiotensin II receptor &amp;#946;-arrestin-biased ligand in Phase&#xD;
      II clinical development for heart failure (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov;&#xD;
      study identifiers: NCT01187836, NCT01444872) a condition affecting an&#xD;
      estimated 23 million people worldwide and for which the current drug&#xD;
      market was estimated at $11.2 billion in 2010 and predicted to grow to&#xD;
      $18.6 billion by 2016)H; and 2) a G-protein-dependent biased&#xD;
      ligand for the mu-opioid receptor in Phase I for acute post-operative pain&#xD;
      (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov,&#xD;
      study identifier: NCT01514578), addressing an opioid analgesic market&#xD;
      predicted to reach $17 billion by 2015I. The company also has a&#xD;
      number of other projects in preclinical development and lead optimisation.&#xD;
      Thus, arguably, patients in the Phase II trial are already beginning to&#xD;
      benefit from the first of these biased signalling drugs. With the usual&#xD;
      timeframe for drug discovery to new drug regulatory approval being 10 - 15&#xD;
      years, the majority of new biased ligand drugs are likely to have an&#xD;
      impact on human health within the next 5 - 10 years.&#xD;
    Impact Beneficiaries&#xD;
      The principal beneficiaries of the impact of this research have been the&#xD;
      global Pharma and Biotech drug discovery industry (e.g. GSK, Novartis, AZ,&#xD;
      Heptares), reagent providers to that industry (e.g. DiscoveRx, Molecular&#xD;
      Devices, Perkin-Elmer, Life Technologies) and contract research&#xD;
      organisations providing compound screening services (e.g. BioFocus). For&#xD;
      the latter two categories, the direct benefits have been increases in&#xD;
      revenue from the enhanced range of products and/or services they have&#xD;
      provided as a consequence. For the pharmaceutical and biotech industry the&#xD;
      benefits have been an improved likelihood of successful drug development.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Members of the Pharmacology Research Group identified hitherto unknown&#xD;
      properties of G protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs): that ligands can signal&#xD;
      differentially through both G-protein-coupled and &amp;#946;-arrestin pathways.&#xD;
      This led to the concept of GPCR `biased signalling' and development of&#xD;
      fluorescent reporters to quantify &amp;#946;-arrestin signalling. These discoveries&#xD;
      have been adopted widely by the pharmaceutical industry, attracting&#xD;
      R&amp;amp;D investment and collaborative research funding, to drive discovery&#xD;
      of new drugs operating through `biased signalling'. The commercial&#xD;
      opportunity has also been exploited by screening reagent providers and&#xD;
      contract screening organisations. These discoveries will ultimately&#xD;
      produce better drugs to treat GPCR-based diseases to improve human health.&#xD;

    Discovery of GPCR `biased signalling' as a novel pharmacological&#xD;
        concept, enabling development of pathway-selective therapeutic drugs.&#xD;
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Biological Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>&#xD;
    At the time of the original underpinning research, the basic concept in&#xD;
      receptor pharmacology was that agonists at a particular G&#xD;
      protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) had a particular potency and efficacy for&#xD;
      stimulating a response that was always via a specific G protein-mediated&#xD;
      signalling pathway. The adenosine A1-receptor is a GPCR that&#xD;
      normally couples to Gi-proteins to mediate inhibition of intracellular&#xD;
      cyclic AMP formation. However, work from the laboratory of Professor Steve&#xD;
      Hill in the Pharmacology group, funded by the Wellcome Trust7,8&#xD;
      provided early evidence that specific adenosine A1-agonists&#xD;
      could direct signalling to other G-protein (e.g. Gs, Gi) signalling&#xD;
      pathways1,2. However, the concept of signalling&#xD;
      pathway-dependent responses, or `biased signalling' was taken to a new&#xD;
      level by research on the &amp;#946;2-adrenoceptor performed by Professor&#xD;
      Jillian Baker, also in the Pharmacology group, during her Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust-funded9 work (2000-2003) undertaken under the supervision&#xD;
      of Professor Hill. This work showed that the prototypical &amp;#946;-blocker,&#xD;
      propranolol, acted as an inverse agonist (antagonist) at the &amp;#946;2-adrenoceptor&#xD;
      on Gs-mediated increases in cyclic AMP accumulation but it acts as an&#xD;
      agonist of G-protein-independent &amp;#946;-arrestin signalling at the same&#xD;
      receptor, signalling via MAP kinase to alter gene expression. The key&#xD;
      discovery of the dual agonist/inverse agonist action of propranolol at&#xD;
      &amp;#946;2-adrenoceptors was first published as a poster abstract in 2002&#xD;
      (Baker, Hall and Hill (2002) Br. J. Pharmacol. 136: 5P)&#xD;
      and then as a full paper in 20033. The observation of `dual&#xD;
      efficacy' agonists acting via different, G-protein dependent and&#xD;
      &amp;#946;-arrestin signalling pathways was independently confirmed in&#xD;
      concurrent research that was reported in 2003 by the research groups of M&#xD;
      Bouvier for &amp;#946;2-adrenoceptors and RJ Lefkowitz for angiotensin II&#xD;
      receptors, thus jointly establishing for the first time the principle of&#xD;
      `biased signalling' or `biased agonism' in GPCR pharmacology. The group in&#xD;
      Nottingham has since contributed to the development of new assay formats&#xD;
      to investigate the coupling of GPCRs to &amp;#946;-arrestin pathways4,5.&#xD;
    Prof Baker's expertise in &amp;#946;-adrenoceptor pharmacology, further funded&#xD;
      by a Wellcome Trust Clinician Scientist Fellowship10, was also&#xD;
      applied to the elucidation of a high resolution &amp;#946;-adrenoceptor crystal&#xD;
      structure6 &amp;#8212; a significant milestone for structure-based GPCR&#xD;
      drug design. This subsequently resulted in Wellcome Trust funding11&#xD;
      of &amp;#163;2.88 million (2008-2012) to Prof Baker and Prof Hill, with Prof Peter&#xD;
      Fischer and Prof Barrie Kellam (School of Pharmacy) to develop new&#xD;
      &amp;#946;1-selective &amp;#946;-blockers for treatment of cardiac disease with&#xD;
      concurrent respiratory disease.&#xD;

    Education: enriching students' appreciation of the interpretative
        nature of history Educational impact has always been the main focus
      of the project [a]. Initial scoping demonstrations in Phase 1 (2008/9)
      involved five teachers and 100 Year 9 students across three schools. As a
      result of noting the potential to link the project to the then emerging
      Personal Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) which schools were to be
      required to assess and blend into the curriculum, Chantry High School, a
      mid-sized comprehensive in Ipswich, became the team's partners in:
    
      creating and evaluating a package of learning activities for a
        ten-hour Humanities programme using Bristol's virtual model to deliver
        PLTS objectives [b].
      developing a prototype product/service which could be made safe and
        accessible to all schools and universities through migration from Second
        Life (SL) to Open Sim.
    
    In phase 2 (2010 onwards), the team has extended the trial, involving
      demonstrations at two Bristol schools (Cotham and Red Maids', 80-plus
      students), trials with sample groups at three schools (St Mary Redcliffe
      and Temple (SMRT), Fairfield High and Redland Green, 60-plus students,
      2012/13) and pedagogical discussions with local History and Classics
      teachers. They have also taken opportunities to promote the project across
      the country, for example presenting at a teaching-enrichment day at North
      London Collegiate Schools (2013) and various educational conferences (see
      section 2). In order to evaluate educational impact, the researchers
      gather data through observation [b], group discussion with students and
      teachers during and after sessions [c], written feedback gathered from
      students and quantitative data collected using voting technology.
    The significant impact and benefits to the students have been:
    
      Helping students grasp the contingent nature of `interpretations' of
        the past &amp;#8212; that is to say, understanding the part that reception plays
        in the construction of historical interpretation and narrative. This is
        particularly demonstrated by class discussions at SMRT, in which
        students talked about how their concept of history and historical `fact'
        had changed, noting, for example, `I find it quite annoying when someone
        tells us that this IS what happened'; `it gives you the challenge to
        peel back the layers of history... even if it gives you less of an
        insight into the actual event, it can give you more of an insight on the
        previous group of people looking at the event'': [c]. One student even
        remarked when realising that what might be presented as historical facts
        can be unreliable and open to interpretation, `It's quite scary'. All
        groups were able to transfer this experience to other periods of history
        they had studied. The SMRT team noted that the project `was able to
        facilitate a debate which demonstrated thinking and reasoning skills of
        a standard I have rarely seen at Key Stage 3' [d]. Commenting straight
        after the lesson the teacher said `That activity on its own is
        brilliant... I can't think of anything else you could use to do it' [c].
      Helping students appreciate how past events impact on the present:
        students were able to reflect on the ways in which issues they had
        learned about in the study of Victorian Britain might have been
        influenced by ancient practice &amp;#8212; for instance and in particular,
        slavery. Students enjoyed the opportunity to find out more about periods
        they felt they knew little about beforehand, and in this sense
        particularly, this project's blend of the Victorian and the Roman
        allowed students to learn more about Classics than would ever be the
        case on the standard curriculum [b].
      Establishing a `sense of period' to provide context for larger
        historical questions, particularly through the walk-through timeline
        along which students first travel to the model (reckoned to have `vast
        potential for the teaching of chronology' [e]) and attitudes and
        experiences voiced by robot avatars. The behaviour of students adopting
        the character of the period avatars they were given, included texting in
        `Victorian-ese' [b] and inventing informed back stories about
        characters' relationships. Students particularly identified with
        experiences of status and gender discrimination their characters
        suffered at the hand of robot avatars [c] and Fairfield High found this
        the `most useful' part of the experience [f].
      Giving enhanced opportunities for self-development through the
        opportunity to experience a historical context for themselves. Redland
        Green noted that the model's environment `lends itself to independent
        learning brilliantly' [e]. At Chantry, the team noted that the different
        mode of delivery and familiarity with technology engaged a number of
        boys who were usually reluctant to get involved in class [b]. One boy at
        SMRT said, `this project has allowed me to come out of my shell a bit
        more and it's given me more confidence' [c]. Another reflected on a
        life-lesson learned: `you've got to make your own decision. You can't
        just let people give it to you and just take it because they might have
        manipulated it. You need to decide for yourself what you think' [c].
    
    In July 2013, the team met with the teachers involved in the Bristol
      trials, and some interested future partners, to share experiences and
      discuss ways to develop a genuinely collaborative teaching and learning
      package. All teachers thought that their students had benefited from
      participation and that their own aims had been met. There was great
      enthusiasm for continued involvement in the project. Some particular
      avenues for further exploration include:
    
      Redland Green, SMRT and new partner Cathedral School are especially
        interested in using the online environment as a space 'for developing
        opportunities for valuable cross-school collaboration' [d]; a feature
        that `other teachers would surely be interested in' [e].
      Red Maids' are predominantly interested in the development of the
        model specifically to serve the module on Roman domestic space in GCSE
        Classical Civilisations. They feel that it could serve as an `excellent
        learning tool' in helping students explore the space of the Roman house
        and furthermore better equip them with the skills to answer examination
        questions which often ask students to `imagine' life in Pompeii [g].
      Fairfield High have offered ideas for developing material that would
        help extend the project from its focus audience of school students
        following Gifted and Talented programmes to meet the needs of the trial
        group with which the team worked there, predominantly `pupil premium
        students' and `students with English as an additional language', thus
        extending its impact through the school-age population of the city [f].
    
    Heritage: supporting activities of local heritage groups in promoting
        awareness of and access to archive material and knowledge pertaining to
        the Crystal Palace
    Since the dissolution of the GLC, there has been little investment in the
      Crystal Palace Park. In 2008, the London Development Agency produced a
      white paper on the future of the park, and the Bristol project was named
      as a possible partner in the development of an interpretation strategy
      [h]. A much pared-down masterplan was approved in December 2010 but, due
      to financial concerns, it is yet to be effected.
    As a result, a DVD of Bristol's model for display in the small,
      volunteer-run and donation-funded Crystal Palace Museum, which attracts
      8,000 visitors annually, provides an immediate impact. The video
      fly-through, installed in 2013, is the only visualisation of the interior
      of the lost Palace. It will have educational benefit to local schools, who
      use the Museum as a resource for local history, and to visitors. It will
      assist local amateur societies in their endeavours to develop the displays
      at the Park and in other ways (e.g., by a mobile phone app). The Director
      of the Museum and its trustees wrote that they are `so impressed with your
      efforts to date to do something that no one else has achieved'. They have
      been extremely supportive of the project throughout, sharing archive
      material and discussing ideas for taking our partnership forward through
      further collaboration on display material [i].
    Online Presence and Dissemination: the presence of the Bristol team's
        outputs on various online platforms has disseminated awareness of the
        Palace and of the project's contents and aims to a global audience and
        has contributed to wider online debates about, for example, the presence
        of educational sims in Second Life.
    The team have endeavoured to extend the reach of the project through
      dissemination in a number of media. The project has been covered by local
      press, appearing in the Bristol Evening Post, Ipswich Evening
        Star and Crystal Palace News (online newsletter).The team
      has presented its work at a number of public events, including university
      public engagement activities, talks to special-interest groups, and
      large-scale public events such as the Crystal Palace Arts Festival 2009
      and Discover 2010. In 2012, the researchers were invited to California to
      speak about their model at the Getty Museum as part of a public engagement
      day promoting its exhibition, The Last Days of Pompeii, to 600
      ticket-holders. The model in SL is permanently open to online users and
      two videos (one of them the video made for the Museum) are available on
      YouTube and our website. Although the researchers cannot track visitor
      numbers to the online model per se, the optional virtual guide has been
      downloaded more than 2,760 times. Interest among the SL community is
      indicated by repeated reference to Bristol's project in blogs such as Prim
        Perfect (which has featured the project three times), particularly
      with regard to the debate about the difficulties of sustaining educational
      presence in a commercial environment like SL, and by the dedication of an
      episode of Designing Worlds on Treet TV (SL TV station) to the
      Bristol model [j]. Over 8,000 people visited the project blog over three
      years and 65 engaged comments from readers in the UK, US and Europe were
      live on the website on 31st July 2013 [a].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Hundreds of school students, their teachers, local heritage groups,
      audiences at live events and thousands of people engaging in online
      activities have benefited from a University of Bristol research project
      called Resurrecting the Past: Virtual Antiquities in the Nineteenth
      Century. The project uses the medium of a 3D online model of the Pompeian
      Court of the Crystal Palace to promote awareness of the Palace and provide
      access to knowledge about it. Just as significantly, the project has
      explored how history is interpreted and inspired innovative ways of
      teaching. The research has not only illuminated a particular place and
      period but also investigated the relationships between 19th-century
      physical and 21st-century virtual reconstruction. Perhaps most
      importantly, it has given young people a deeper, transferable
      understanding of the nature of history and historical `facts'.

    Background
    Research conducted by Dr Shelley Hales (Senior Lecturer in Art &amp;amp;
      Visual Culture in the University of Bristol's Department of Classics &amp;amp;
      Ancient History) concentrates on Roman houses (most significantly explored
      in a 2003 monograph [1]) and the reception of Pompeii (examined in a 2011
      co-edited volume [3]). Her work on reception focuses particularly on
      19th-century reconstructions of Pompeian houses. Dr Hales' work on the
      1856 Maison Pomp&amp;#233;ienne, `Living with Arria Marcella: Novel Interiors in la
      Maison Pomp&amp;#233;ienne' will appear in S. Hales and M. Leander-Touati (eds), Returns
        to Pompeii (Swedish Institute of Archaeology, 2014). She is also the
      author of the first article to consider the contents and reception of the
      Crystal Palace's Pompeian Court [2].
    The Sydenham Crystal Palace opened in 1854 as a `museum to instruct,
      amuse and interest'. Its greatest innovation was to achieve these aims
      through reconstruction and as such was an early experiment in the ways in
      which reconstruction might serve entertainment, education and research and
      make the past accessible to wide audiences. Its series of courts
      showcasing past civilizations included a replica Pompeian house which was
      destroyed when the Palace burnt down in 1936.
    The research
    Dr Hales' interest in exploring these values of reconstruction led her to
      collaborate with Dr Nic Earle (e-Learning Co-ordinator in Bristol's
      Education Support Unit) to found the research project, Resurrecting the
      Past: Virtual Antiquities in the Nineteenth Century, in 2008. The project
      explores reconstruction, both as a Victorian and contemporary practice,
      through the creation of a 3D, online virtual model of the Pompeian Court.
      The model interacts with, rather than simply presents, the Victorians' own
      attempt to visualise Pompeii, by mimicking, critiquing and comparing it
      with today's technologies, museological attitudes and learning theories.
      As well as providing an environment in which to conduct research, the
      model acts as an online archive of the contents of and sources pertaining
      to the Court and as an interactive environment, populated with information
      and robot characters, with which to engage audiences.
    Phase 1 (October 2008-September 2009) was funded by JISC's `Enhancing
      Digital Collections' programme. The award of &amp;#163;44,159, matched by
      institutional contributions, enabled the Bristol team to build the model,
      launch the website and consult with school students (Bristol Grammar,
      Clifton High, Chantry High) and heritage groups (Crystal Palace
      Foundation, Crystal Palace Museum, Joseph Paxton Society), gathering
      feedback which informed the design of the model and its functionalities.
      Research papers were presented at the following conferences: Electronic
      Visualisation in the Arts (British Computing Centre), JISC Digitisation
      (Cirencester), Digital Resources for the Humanities and Arts (Belfast),
      Association of Learning Technology (Manchester), Democratic Turn (OU,
      Milton Keynes); and at these workshops: Innovative Uses of Teaching and
      Learning Space in History, Classics &amp;amp; Archaeology, Subject Centre for
      Classics, History &amp;amp; Archaeology (Warwick), Democratic Turn (Oxford),
      What is to be done with the Crystal Palace? (York), as well as the
      Classics and History of Art research seminars (Bristol). A paper
      reflecting on this phase, `"A copy &amp;#8212; or rather a translation...with
      numerous sparkling emendations." Re-rebuilding the Crystal Palace', will
      appear in a forthcoming edited volume: K. Nichols &amp;amp; S. Turner eds, What's
        to be Done with the Crystal Palace? (Manchester University Press,
      2015).
    Phase 2 (from August 2010) was funded by a University of Bristol
      Enterprise and Impact Development Fund award (a competitive award to
      develop projects demonstrating strong impact) of &amp;#163;14,999, which allows the
      team to use the model to enhance learning in local secondary schools and
      improve access and enhance resources in the Palace heritage sector.
      Simultaneously, the researchers' observations of school trials and
      collection of feedback informs Bristol's academic research on the role of
      reconstruction in teaching and learning. The team is working with Dr Sue
      Timmis (Graduate School of Education) to publish the results in an
      education journal.

    Surrey research on the concepts of strained-layer devices has made a&#xD;
      major economic impact. This impact was first achieved via close&#xD;
      interaction with the electronics firm, Philips N.V. They were prepared to&#xD;
      take the risk with what was considered at the time to be an unusual&#xD;
      approach, and in 2000 they licensed the Surrey patent (ref. 2) on using&#xD;
      strain to create non-absorbing mirrors. The technology proved to be&#xD;
      superior to other approaches existing at the time for telecommunications&#xD;
      applications. Philips (and later JDS) subsequently used the non-absorbing&#xD;
      mirror concept in the development of high power pump lasers, which are&#xD;
      used for optical amplification in telecommunications systems and to pump&#xD;
      high-power fibre lasers, such as those used in manufacturing.&#xD;
    The disruptive nature of the strained-layer technology forced all of the&#xD;
      other semiconductor laser manufacturers to adopt it. Dr. Andrew Carter,&#xD;
      the Chief Technology Officer at Oclaro, one of the world's largest&#xD;
      telecommunications companies, has stated that the Surrey research has&#xD;
      "revolutionised aspects of the design" of optoelectronic devices [Source&#xD;
      S1].&#xD;
    The majority of semiconductor-based photonics components now use&#xD;
      strained-layer quantum wells as embedded technology, which represents a&#xD;
      major economic impact of the research. According to Photonics21, the&#xD;
      European task force for photonics, the global market for these components&#xD;
      was around &amp;#8364;15bn in 2009 and is expected to grow to &amp;gt;&amp;#8364;30bn by 2015&#xD;
      [S2]. Furthermore, the component market levers much larger industries, e.g.&#xD;
      telecoms services worth more than &amp;#8364;2 trillion at current estimates [S2].&#xD;
      As evidence of the reach of the economic impact of the research, it is&#xD;
      notable that almost all of the current known semiconductor laser&#xD;
      technology incorporates the strained-layer concept developed at Surrey.&#xD;
      Peter Selway, formerly the Director of Operations at Nortel, has&#xD;
      explained: "The use of appropriately strained layers gives benefits in&#xD;
      almost all aspects of the performance of semiconductor lasers, so much so&#xD;
      that laser engineers routinely use strain to fine-tune the performance of&#xD;
      virtually all lasers for all applications." [S3]&#xD;
    The strained-layer quantum well concept is now being employed in InGaN&#xD;
      based solid-state lighting, which is starting to become the core for all&#xD;
      future lighting technology. In this application, the ability to&#xD;
      incorporate strain provides a method of optimising the emission wavelength&#xD;
      of the InGaN LEDs used in solid-state lighting luminaires. The current&#xD;
      market for lighting is worth &amp;#8364;50bn and is expected to grow to &amp;#8364;100bn by&#xD;
      2020. Strained-layer quantum well LEDs are expected to form a core aspect&#xD;
      of this technology [S2]. The recently commercialised Philips LED lamp,&#xD;
      which was the recipient of the U.S.A. Department of Energy's first-ever "L&#xD;
      Prize" [S4], utilises strained quantum wells.&#xD;
    The new material reported in ref. 3 (Section 3) is now being implemented&#xD;
      in distributed feedback (DFB) and tunable lasers for telecommunications by&#xD;
      UK-based CIP and global telecoms giant, Oclaro, and is directly derived&#xD;
      from Surrey's research in the TSB-sponsored ETOE and ETOE2 projects.&#xD;
    Prof. Sugawara (Fujitsu, Japan) made use of the results of Surrey&#xD;
      research (ref. 4 in Section 3) when he set-up QD Laser Inc. to&#xD;
      commercialise the technology of quantum dot lasers. Their 1.3 &amp;#181;m quantum&#xD;
      dot lasers, which are currently commercialised, rely on p-doping to&#xD;
      provide temperature insensitivity. The mechanism by which this&#xD;
      insensitivity occurs and can be utilised was described in the Surrey&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
    The Photonics Group's research in developing new semiconductor materials&#xD;
      and devices for renewable energy has made an impact on society by&#xD;
      capturing the public's attention and stimulating discussion. The research&#xD;
      has received wide exposure in international publications for general&#xD;
      audiences, such as The Economist [S5] (receiving &amp;gt;760 Facebook&#xD;
      likes, &amp;gt;100 re-tweets on Twitter, and &amp;gt;30 direct comments from the&#xD;
      public) and National Geographic [S6] (receiving &amp;gt;350 Facebook&#xD;
      likes, &amp;gt;130 re-tweets on Twitter, &amp;gt;100 Google+ recommendations and&#xD;
      10 direct comments from the public). The research was also highlighted in&#xD;
      national newspaper articles in The Independent, The Observer [S7]&#xD;
      (&amp;gt;70 direct comments from the public), The Sunday Times [S8],&#xD;
      the Times of India [S9], and more than ten trade journals in the&#xD;
      solar cell community. A television feature was produced by RAI (Italy) for&#xD;
      their Superquark popular science programme [S10], and a radio programme&#xD;
      was broadcast by ORF Radio (Austria). The potential of Surrey's recent&#xD;
      research on bismide materials to reduce the energy demands of the internet&#xD;
      was featured in the Financial Times [S11].&#xD;
    The Sunday Times article led to a direct request by the UK's&#xD;
      Energy Minister (Charles Hendry, MP) to visit the University to learn more&#xD;
      about the emerging field of research on using solar energy from space. Mr&#xD;
      Hendry commented: "The work that Prof. Sweeney of the ATI and his&#xD;
      colleagues are doing makes us realise that the way we'll be generating&#xD;
      electricity in 20 years' time is radically different to the way in which&#xD;
      it's being done today" [S12]. This ministerial visit and statement attest&#xD;
      the extent to which the Surrey activities are having an influence on&#xD;
      policy-makers. In addition, impact on industrial policy is made via&#xD;
      Sweeney's membership on Astrium's Photonics Strategy Group and&#xD;
      contributions to the UK Roadmap in Optoelectronics.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Surrey's Photonics Group has played a pivotal role in understanding and&#xD;
      developing compound semiconductors for use in photonic devices. The&#xD;
      strained-layer quantum well technology proposed and developed in their&#xD;
      research is now incorporated in the vast majority of CD, DVD and blu-ray&#xD;
      systems, in telecommunications and the internet, in computer mice, and in&#xD;
      LEDs for solid-state lighting. Strained-layer quantum well lasers are&#xD;
      manufactured by industry in their millions annually with a market value&#xD;
      estimated in 2009 to be &amp;#8364;15bn. Compared to the alternatives; these lasers&#xD;
      offer greater efficiency, which has opened up new applications.&#xD;
    The Group's research has expanded to develop semiconductors for use in&#xD;
      energy generation and combatting climate change, and in novel&#xD;
      photovoltaics, low energy internet communications, and greenhouse gas&#xD;
      detection. The research has led to engagement with the UK government's&#xD;
      energy minister and has stimulated public discussion around the world.&#xD;

    One of the key achievements of the underlying research can be traced back&#xD;
      to the mid-1990s when the idea of Prof. Alf Adams, FRS, for using strained&#xD;
      layers in quantum well lasers was verified theoretically and&#xD;
      experimentally [1]. Prof. Adams and Prof. Eoin O'Reilly (who left the&#xD;
      University in 2000) showed that by deliberately incorporating a thin&#xD;
      semiconductor layer (i.e. a quantum well) with different lattice&#xD;
      constant to the host crystal substrate, the resulting strain would bring a&#xD;
      number of enhanced optical properties. These properties make lasers,&#xD;
      optical amplifiers and other optoelectronic components more efficient and&#xD;
      faster in operation. Strained-layer devices were demonstrated commercially&#xD;
      by Philips, working with Surrey researchers, and extended to applications&#xD;
      in high power laser diodes for manufacturing and printing. Adams extended&#xD;
      the idea of using strain from lattice mismatch to create non-absorbing&#xD;
      mirrors in high power lasers, as was described in a patent [2].&#xD;
    More recently, under the direction of Prof. Stephen Sweeney, the&#xD;
      Photonics Group has made large inroads into developing alternative III-V&#xD;
      material approaches for high efficiency lasers. They demonstrated that&#xD;
      1550 nm InGaAlAs quantum well buried heterostructure lasers offer superior&#xD;
      high temperature performance [3]. Other research, in collaboration with Dr&#xD;
      Andreev (senior lecturer in the Photonics Group), described how p-doping&#xD;
      in InAs/GaAs quantum dots imparts improved temperature stability in&#xD;
      semiconductor lasers [4].&#xD;
    Research on quantum well lasers, published by the Group in 1999, showed&#xD;
      that even in the best strained-layer quantum well lasers, the efficiency&#xD;
      is governed by non-radiative Auger processes involving the spin-orbit band&#xD;
      [5]. This finding led to work on new materials where the spin-orbit&#xD;
      splitting energy could be increased to remove the Auger processes.&#xD;
      Recently, another patent has been published by the Group [6] on an&#xD;
      entirely new class of III-V semiconductor (based on bismuth alloys), which&#xD;
      provides an optimised band structure offering power savings of 80% due to&#xD;
      loss suppression. The inclusion of bismuth in a III-V material increases&#xD;
      the spin-orbit splitting energy whilst reducing the band gap. When the&#xD;
      spin-orbit splitting energy exceeds the band gap energy, the major Auger&#xD;
      processes are inhibited, thus reducing the sensitivity of lasers to&#xD;
      changes in ambient temperature. Initial experimental evidence that this&#xD;
      concept can be achieved in practice was recently reported [7].&#xD;
    In parallel, the Photonics Group has been working closely with&#xD;
      EADS-Astrium to develop new semiconductor materials for photovoltaics to&#xD;
      capture solar energy in space. Highly efficient (&amp;gt;43%) photovoltaic&#xD;
      cells have been designed and tested at Surrey and are part of a pilot&#xD;
      programme to develop space-based solar power. This collaborative research&#xD;
      has formed the basis of a European Space Agency pilot study involving&#xD;
      Surrey to develop a fully working prototype.&#xD;

    The impact of the research described above has been both on the work of
      large industrial
      companies (Unilever PLC), as well as industrial research institutes
      (I2T3). In both cases the
      methods developed in the research were directly applied to problems of
      industrial relevance.
    I2T3 (Innovazione Industriale Tramite Trasferimento Tecnologico Onlus) is
      based in Florence and is
      an industrial research and technology transfer organisation. This was
      funded for start up, by the
      Chamber of Commerce of Florence, the Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze, the
      Fraunhofer Institut and
      the University of Florence, and brought together industrial and academic
      partners. Its Vice-President
      describes direct impact of the methods developed in this research on a
      technologically relevant
      project called "MAC-GEO". The project concerned modelling of the evolution
      of geothermal
      reservoirs and I2T3's contribution focused on phase equilibria of
      geothermal mixtures. The project
      was worth 800k Euro overall, but involved also data collecting, database
      organization so that this
      modelling part had a budget of ca. 200k Euro. Polydispersity came in both
      as part of the main
      dynamic model and, of course, in solving the phase equilibrium conditions.
      I2T3 had a contract to
      work on phase equilibrium calculation and chemical kinetics between rock
      matrix and geothermal
      fluid. I2T3's Vice-President emphasizes that the phase equilibrium
      calculations were possible only
      because of the efficient numerical methods arising out of the research in
      this case study. He is also
      conducting a feasibility analysis for a project for a company that makes
      compressors and might be
      interested in developing modelling software in which liquid/gas phase
      transitions of polydisperse
      fluids are taken into account.
    I2T3's Vice-President also reports several other instances of impact,
      including modelling of
      blowdown processes in hydrocarbon pressure vessels (with I2T3 and
      Snamprogetti spa, at that time
      part of the ENI group, now sold to SAIPEM), and a project with ENI to
      model wax formation in
      pipelines where again hydrocarbon mixtures were involved. The results for
      the impact at
      Snamprogetti were presented at a SIMAI (Societa Italiana di Matematica
      Applicata e Industriale)
      conference, in a symposium about oil and gas-related mathematical
      modelling that had significant
      attendance from industry. More significantly, the moment method was
      incorporated directly in
      blowdown process simulation software delivered to Snamprogetti, where it
      was then used in the pre-design
      of hydrocarbon pressure vessels.
    Unilever is the world's third largest consumer goods company. It owns
      over 400 brands, including
      several with annual sales exceeding one billion euros. Its products
      include foods, beverages,
      cleaning agents and products for personal care and hygiene. Many of these
      products are
      polydisperse in nature. Food products such as mayonnaise or margarine are
      typically colloidal
      mixtures of several different ingredients (including plant oil, fatty
      acids, water and plant-sterols). The
      same is true for home and personal care products, many of which are
      sophisticated blends of
      surfactants, polymers and colloids. It is essential for processability and
      usability of these substances
      that they can be designed to be stable against demixing of their
      components, for the entire range of
      ambient temperatures at which they are used, stored, or processed.
    A substantial amount of work is therefore invested at the Unilever
      research labs to formulate
      compositions that ensure such stability of their products. The
      polydispersity research described in
      section 3 has provided concepts and insights which have streamlined this
      work [see for example
      "Flory-Huggins theory for the solubility of heterogeneously-modified
      polymers", P. B. Warren,
      Macromolecules 40, 6709 (2007)]. Particularly in the area of computer
      aided formulation, the ideas
      are expected to lead to significant savings in research efforts, faster
      development cycles, shorter
      time-to-market, and improved flexibility and efficiency in the supply
      chain.
    In a supporting letter, a senior scientist at Unilever describes the
      impact of the research,
      emphasizing the conceptual impact as follows: "Indeed, I may add that the
      polydispersity work now
      shapes my thinking in a deep way. In computer-aided formulation we are
      investigating of the phase
      behaviour of alkyl chain terminated surfactants. Polydispersity in the
      alkyl chain length is a concern,
      but I think a key insight from the polydispersity work is that it is
      legitimate to estimate the effect by a
      2- or 3-component mixture...." In this way the conceptual insights from
      the moment free energy have
      an impact on Unilever's day to day work. Concerning the resulting savings
      in research efforts for a
      typical characterisation project, the senior scientist further comments:
      "... It is difficult to quantify the
      impact in financial terms though if we say it saved 6 months of
      characterisation effort, we can make
      a very rough justification that this corresponds to &amp;#163;50m. This is
      indicative of the scale of savings that
      have continued to accrue since."
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research by Prof Sollich and collaborators has led to new ways of looking
      at the problem of
      understanding the phase behaviour (phase transitions like freezing and
      melting, or demixing in oil-water
      mixtures) of systems which are polydisperse in that they contain an
      effectively infinite number
      of different particle species. This is the situation with many
      industrially important materials: e.g. in
      emulsion paint, the colloidal paint particles have an essentially
      continuous spread of diameters.
      Beyond conceptual progress, the research has resulted in efficient
      numerical algorithms for
      predicting phase equilibria. Specifically, it has led to significant
      savings in industrial research
      processes and thus has had both economic impact and impact on
      practitioners and professional
      services.

    Conceptual insights and numerical methods for polydisperse phase
      behaviour
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Mathematical Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    The underlying research relates to understanding and predicting phase
      behaviour: transitions
      between different states of matter or "phases", like ice, water, steam or
      the various phases of
      anisotropic molecules used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs); or demixing
      transitions into two or more
      phases, as in liquid mixtures like oil and water that may separate at room
      temperature but remain
      mixed at different temperature. The challenge is to predict, from the
      properties of the constituent
      molecules, the number of coexisting phases and their properties, and how
      these change when one
      varies external control parameters like temperature or pressure, or in
      typical "soft matter" systems
      like colloidal suspensions (paint) or emulsions (mayonnaise) the overall
      dilution of the system.
    There are well established approaches for predicting phase behaviour in
      simple systems: a "free
      energy" is calculated as a function of the concentrations of all of the
      species of molecules present,
      and phase separation regions can be found by constructing tangent planes
      to this free energy
      surface. However, in soft systems one has the added complication that e.g.
      colloidal particles are
      never all identical but typically have variations in size (or shape,
      electrical charge etc). This makes
      them very different from atoms or small molecules. In the colloidal case,
      as particle sizes are fixed
      by the process of chemical synthesis, the number of particles in each
      small range of sizes is fixed,
      and so each such range has to be treated as a separate particle species.
      Because the size
      distribution is continuous (rather than a mixture of a few distinct
      sizes), the system is polydisperse: it
      is a mixture of an effectively infinite number of particle species. The
      traditional procedures for
      predicting phase behaviour then become unmanageable both conceptually and
      numerically.
    Polydisperse systems are very widespread in industrial applications. Most
      commercially available
      surfactants (soaps) are polydisperse, and so are polymer additives, often
      highly so. Home and
      personal care product formulations are sophisticated blends of
      surfactants, polymers and colloids,
      and control of phase behaviour is essential for processability and
      usability.
    The research described here successfully tackled the problem of
      predicting phase behaviour in
      polydisperse systems. It was carried out by Peter Sollich in collaboration
      with Michael Cates and
      Patrick Warren from early 1997 to March 2000. The main research
      underpinning the impact,
      particularly as regards the development of efficient numerical algorithms,
      was done by Peter Sollich
      with Alessandro Speranza from September 1999 until September 2002.
    The key insight was that the free energy expressions for many
      polydisperse mixtures contain the full
      details of the polydispersity (the size distribution, in the colloids
      example) only in the "entropy of
      mixing" term. The remainder of the free energy represents the interactions
      between molecules of
      different species and can normally be written as a function of only a few
      moments of the size
      distribution. The research proposed a method of constructing for such free
      energies a "moment free
      energy", which depends on only as many concentration variables as the
      number of moments
      required. Remarkably, this can then be treated like the free energy of a
      simple mixture of a few
      effective particle species, while preserving exactly many properties of
      the original free energy and
      giving accurate approximations for others. Peter Sollich was instrumental
      in developing these
      theoretical insights (with Cates and Warren), which provide a new and
      conceptually powerful way of
      looking at polydisperse phase equilibria. He also developed computer code
      for evaluating the
      predictions of the moment free energy method efficiently. Crucially, this
      code is generic in that in can
      be applied to any free energy with the required moment structure. The
      further research with
      Speranza led to an efficient computational method for extending the
      approach to be numerically
      essentially exact, overcoming the need to approximate in certain regions
      of the phase diagram.

    ICR research into the RAS signalling pathway has led to significant&#xD;
      benefits for patients, especially for the approximately 50% of melanoma&#xD;
      patients with tumours harbouring BRAF mutations. It has also had a major&#xD;
      commercial impact in the pharmaceutical industry through the&#xD;
      identification of new targets for therapeutic development. Many&#xD;
      international pharmaceutical companies have added considerable shareholder&#xD;
      value by adding MEK or BRAF inhibitor products to their cancer therapeutic&#xD;
      pipeline; this commercial benefit has been enabled and facilitated by the&#xD;
      ICR's ongoing underpinning research. Plexxikon, the biotech company which&#xD;
      developed vemurafenib, the first BRAF inhibitor to reach the market, was&#xD;
      acquired in 2011 by Daiichi Sankyo with an investment of over $800 million&#xD;
      upfront. In this acquisition, vemurafenib was a major factor in the&#xD;
      Plexxikon valuation [1].&#xD;
    BRAF Inhibitors&#xD;
      Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK. Unlike many&#xD;
      other malignancies, its incidence continues to rise on a yearly basis at a&#xD;
      rate of 5-7%; this rising incidence is a global phenomenon, with the rate&#xD;
      of increase being higher than for any other malignancy. Age demographics&#xD;
      for the disease are also unusual, with over a quarter of new cases&#xD;
      diagnosed in patients under 50.&#xD;
    Whilst early detection of localised disease allows complete surgical&#xD;
      resection and a potential cure, the historical lack of effective treatment&#xD;
      options for advanced (metastatic) disease means that melanoma accounts for&#xD;
      a significant number of lives lost to cancer. Median survival with&#xD;
      metastatic disease is approximately 6-9 months. Given the young patient&#xD;
      population affected, this represents a significant burden of potential&#xD;
      life years lost and thus melanoma is a malignancy of increasing&#xD;
      epidemiological significance. The development of targeted therapies on the&#xD;
      basis of ICR research (such as vemurafenib) have, for the first time in&#xD;
      the history of metastatic malignant melanoma treatments, resulted in&#xD;
      improved survival outcomes for patients.&#xD;
    In 2013, over 20 novel selective BRAF inhibitors are being developed&#xD;
      commercially and two of these, vemurafenib (Roche) and dabrafenib (GSK),&#xD;
      are now on the market. Vemurafenib received FDA marketing approval in 2011&#xD;
      [2] and Canadian and European [3] marketing approval in 2012; it is also&#xD;
      NICE approved (NICE guidance TA269) [4]. Dabrafenib received FDA [5] and&#xD;
      European [6] marketing approval in 2013 and is under review by NICE. It is&#xD;
      estimated that globally over 12,000 patients were treated with vemurafenib&#xD;
      in the period from launch to 31st July 2013 [7]. As evidenced by the&#xD;
      approval by NICE of vemurafenib these new drugs represent a major&#xD;
      improvement in treatment prospects for melanoma patients.&#xD;
    The ICR, in partnership with the Wellcome Trust, patented mutant BRAF as&#xD;
      a target for drug screens and patient testing in 2001 [8]. The patent has&#xD;
      five inventors of which four were ICR Faculty at that time (Marshall,&#xD;
      Marais, Stratton, Wooster), which demonstrates the pivotal role that ICR&#xD;
      scientists played in the discovery. The ICR and the Wellcome Trust made&#xD;
      the strategic decision to file a patent early, well before the publication&#xD;
      came out, so that they would have a dominant patent position. The patent&#xD;
      has enabled us to out-license widely on a non-exclusive basis to&#xD;
      facilitate worldwide drug discovery. Currently there are 12 licensees of&#xD;
      this patent and, since 2008, &amp;#163;221,000 of licensing income has been&#xD;
      received, indicating the investment of commercial resources into projects&#xD;
      that relate directly to the ICR's underpinning research.&#xD;
    The discovery by the ICR that mutant BRAF is an oncogene has led to the&#xD;
      clinical stratification of certain cancers such as melanoma. The&#xD;
      development by pharmaceutical companies of inhibitors that specifically&#xD;
      target mutant BRAF driven tumours means that patients have to be screened&#xD;
      first before treatment to identify if they are suitable for these new&#xD;
      therapies. A number of diagnostic companies have developed tests for&#xD;
      mutant BRAF and have had these tests approved by the FDA and other&#xD;
      regulatory authorities. The marketing of these tests has added commercial&#xD;
      value to these companies and this is all a direct result of the ICR's&#xD;
      fundamental research.&#xD;
    The publication of the molecular structure of mutant BRAF by ICR&#xD;
      researchers was another key step in enabling companies worldwide to&#xD;
      develop their own inhibitor design programmes based on the protein&#xD;
      structural information. Over 70 commercial companies have cited the ICR&#xD;
      structural biology work (Research Ref 4 above) (over 60 since 2008),&#xD;
      including Plexxikon and GSK (Web of Science data).&#xD;
    The published ICR research on the paradoxical activation of MAPK through&#xD;
      CRAF following BRAF inhibition demonstrated the mechanism by which&#xD;
      selective BRAF inhibitors can induce squamous cell carcinomas (Research&#xD;
      Refs 5 and 6 above). The elucidation of this mechanism has enabled&#xD;
      companies developing selective inhibitors to invest in strategies to&#xD;
      compensate for the side effects, for example by developing combination&#xD;
      therapies with MEK inhibitors. Such a combination of dabrafenib (BRAF&#xD;
      inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor), developed by GSK, has shown&#xD;
      significantly improved progression-free survival in patients [9].&#xD;
    MEK Inhibitors&#xD;
      ICR research on the oncogenic RAS signalling pathway and its key protein&#xD;
      components has led to worldwide commercial impact through the development&#xD;
      of novel cancer drugs. Following the publication of the pioneering work&#xD;
      demonstrating activation of MEK and ERK by oncogenic RAS, and the finding&#xD;
      that constitutively activated MEK leads to the neoplastic transformation&#xD;
      of cells (Research Ref 1 above), over 20 international pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies have used and cited this research (Web of Science data).&#xD;
      Although the impact began to be realised before 2008, it is only since&#xD;
      that date that international pharmaceutical companies have commenced&#xD;
      large-scale clinical trials of MEK inhibitors with the investment of major&#xD;
      resources into their clinical development (ClinicalTrials.gov lists 112&#xD;
      clinical trials worldwide of MEK inhibitors, 104 of these commenced from&#xD;
      2008 onwards). Since 2008, over 12,000 patients have participated in MEK&#xD;
      inhibitor clinical trials worldwide and 10 different products are in&#xD;
      development (ClinicalTrials.gov). One product, trametinib, developed by&#xD;
      GSK, was approved by the FDA in May 2013 for use in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation [6]&#xD;
      and is currently under review by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal&#xD;
      Products for Human Use. It is now generating revenue in the international&#xD;
      market with projected sales figures for 2013 of $26M (Thomson Reuters&#xD;
      database).&#xD;
    The ICR, together with its partner the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust&#xD;
      (RM), has played a key role in the clinical studies of MEK inhibitors [10]&#xD;
      (for example CinicalTrials.gov listed trials NCT01682083, NCT01584648,&#xD;
      NCT00773526, NCT01245062 and NCT01449058) and has pioneered studies into&#xD;
      combinations of MEK inhibitors with other drugs: as an example, being the&#xD;
      first UK site to investigate the AKT/MEK combination, specifically MK2206&#xD;
      and AZD 6244. The combination studies point to improved patient outcomes&#xD;
      over single therapy [11].&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) have played a&#xD;
      central role in analysing the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cell signalling pathway and&#xD;
      defining targets for novel cancer therapeutics. Their research work was&#xD;
      key in stimulating an international effort to develop MEK inhibitors.&#xD;
      Subsequently, ICR scientists predicted that the BRAF protein would be a&#xD;
      key node in this pathway and they made the significant discovery that&#xD;
      mutant BRAF is an oncogene. This prompted an international search&#xD;
      for BRAF inhibitors, which was facilitated by the ICR's structural biology&#xD;
      studies of BRAF. As a result, two novel drugs are now on the market.&#xD;

    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Biological Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>&#xD;
    From 1993 onwards Professor Chris Marshall (ICR Faculty) was leading a&#xD;
      team (which included Dr Richard Marais, a postdoc at the time) probing the&#xD;
      RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. This work showed that oncogenic RAS&#xD;
      activates ERK through MEK and that the RAF proteins lie between RAS and&#xD;
      MEK in the pathway sequence. The team cloned the MEK1 gene, making&#xD;
      the key discovery that constitutively activated MEK could oncogenically&#xD;
      transform cells, thus demonstrating that MEK could be an important&#xD;
      therapeutic target (Ref 1). These findings resulted in an international&#xD;
      drug discovery effort to develop MEK inhibitors, for which the Marshall&#xD;
      team provided many of the reagents.&#xD;
    In 1997, Marais (ICR Faculty, 1998-2012) and Marshall showed that&#xD;
      oncogenic RAS maximally activates BRAF but not CRAF. This led to the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the BRAF gene was the more likely candidate for&#xD;
      possible oncogenic mutation in human cancer (Ref 2). Based on these&#xD;
      studies, in 2001, Marais and Marshall began a collaboration on BRAF with&#xD;
      Professor Michael Stratton (ICR Faculty) and Dr Richard Wooster (ICR&#xD;
      Faculty).&#xD;
    This work resulted in the discovery of BRAF mutations in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of melanomas, 10% of colorectal cancers and a smaller&#xD;
      percentage of other cancers (Ref 3). The research teams of Marais and&#xD;
      Marshall carried out further biological studies, including making the&#xD;
      crucial observation that confirmed mutated BRAF as an oncogene&#xD;
      (Ref 3). This discovery prompted a worldwide search for inhibitors of BRAF&#xD;
      as potential cancer therapeutic agents. The development of effective&#xD;
      inhibitors was facilitated by the research of Professor David Barford (ICR&#xD;
      Faculty) and his team, who elucidated the crystal structure of mutant BRAF&#xD;
      (Ref 4) enabling, for the first time, structure-based approaches to be&#xD;
      used for therapeutic development.&#xD;
    Research into the function of BRAF continued at the ICR under the&#xD;
      direction of Marais and Professor Caroline Springer (ICR Faculty). The&#xD;
      team demonstrated that selective inhibition of BRAF in cells that have NRAS&#xD;
      but not BRAF mutation results in a paradoxical activation of the&#xD;
      MAPK pathway &amp;#8212; through CRAF &amp;#8212; which can lead to mutant RAS driven tumours&#xD;
      (Ref 5). This discovery was based first on animal models and then on&#xD;
      analysis of patients treated with selective BRAF inhibitors in which the&#xD;
      development of squamous cell carcinomas was seen as a side effect (Ref 6).&#xD;
      This research at ICR has contributed to the understanding of how to use&#xD;
      specific BRAF inhibitors in anti-cancer therapy, and to the hypothesis&#xD;
      that combination treatment with MEK inhibitors would be a more effective&#xD;
      therapeutic approach.&#xD;

    The formation of Domainex has had a strong commercial impact worldwide&#xD;
      across a number&#xD;
      areas, including drug discovery, monoclonal antibody production and&#xD;
      agrochemical development.&#xD;
    The invention of combinatorial domain hunting (CDH) by the Pearl team at&#xD;
      the ICR, involving&#xD;
      collaborating scientists from UCL and Birkbeck, represents a major&#xD;
      breakthrough in protein&#xD;
      biology. Before this it was extremely difficult, if not sometimes&#xD;
      impossible, to produce soluble&#xD;
      quantities of many natural proteins. Drug discovery, vaccine development,&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      production and agrochemical development depend on high throughput&#xD;
      screening combined with&#xD;
      structural biology, and these approaches are not possible without large&#xD;
      quantities of soluble&#xD;
      protein. The three founding institutions decided that the best way to make&#xD;
      an impact with CDH&#xD;
      would be to form a start up company to exploit CDH commercially as a&#xD;
      service to science-based&#xD;
      companies worldwide. On this premise, the company Domainex was established&#xD;
      in 2002 with Pearl&#xD;
      as Chief Scientific Officer and a non-executive directorship was held by&#xD;
      the ICR, representing the&#xD;
      three founding institutions.&#xD;
    On the basis of the underpinning research studies by teams led by Pearl,&#xD;
      proof of concept of the&#xD;
      application of CDH to intractable proteins of commercial biotechnological&#xD;
      interest has subsequently&#xD;
      been established. Domainex has made significant advances, particularly in&#xD;
      the impact period, 2008&#xD;
      onwards. Domainex has raised around &amp;#163;5 million in investment finance (&amp;#163;4&#xD;
      million post 2008) and&#xD;
      has expanded such that it now employs over 30 people at its premises in&#xD;
      Cambridge [1]. In 2008,&#xD;
      Domainex' services business became profitable and it continues to do so&#xD;
      today.&#xD;
    Domainex uses its CDH technology on projects paid for by a wide range of&#xD;
      international clients,&#xD;
      and since 2008 over 20 collaborations have been successfully completed.&#xD;
      Drug discovery is the&#xD;
      usual objective of these collaborative projects, but there have also been&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      development and agrochemical projects. At least one of the CDH drug&#xD;
      discovery projects that&#xD;
      Domainex has serviced reached the clinical trials stage of development by&#xD;
      2013 [2]. Most of these&#xD;
      collaborations are not in the public domain for reasons of commercial&#xD;
      confidentiality. Collaborators&#xD;
      Domainex has worked with since 2008 that can be publically disclosed are&#xD;
      UCB Pharma Ltd&#xD;
      (UCB), Ark and Pharmidex. Domainex' clients come from the US, Europe and&#xD;
      Japan.&#xD;
    Domainex' collaboration with UCB was one of its early commercial CDH&#xD;
      projects. This led to&#xD;
      successful engineering of human MEK-1 and the work has now been published&#xD;
      (Research Ref 3&#xD;
      above).&#xD;
    Domainex now offers medicinal chemistry services as well as CDH. Three&#xD;
      medicinal chemistry&#xD;
      programmes in which Domainex has been engaged have resulted in compounds&#xD;
      that are now in&#xD;
      clinical trial and two other programmes are at the pre-clinical stage.&#xD;
      Published examples of the&#xD;
      work of Domainex using its innovative chemistry are Robinson et al. [3]&#xD;
      and Jarvis et al. [4].&#xD;
    Domainex has its own in-house drug discovery programmes based around the&#xD;
      CDH discovery and&#xD;
      its long term objective is to grow this aspect to add value to the&#xD;
      company. Currently, Domainex has&#xD;
      support from the government through the Technology Strategy Board (TSB)&#xD;
      for these programmes&#xD;
      [5]. One in-house drug discovery programme that has used CDH is the&#xD;
      collaboration with the ICR&#xD;
      on developing inhibitors of IKK03b5 [6]. The current status is that the&#xD;
      lead chemical series is in the late&#xD;
      lead optimisation phase and work is progressing towards identifying a&#xD;
      pre-clinical candidate.&#xD;
      Domainex is also collaborating with the ICR and the University of Sussex&#xD;
      on a programme to&#xD;
      develop inhibitors of tankyrase [7, 8]. This programme has been the&#xD;
      successful recipient of two&#xD;
      Wellcome Trust Seeding Drug Discovery awards totalling nearly &amp;#163;8 million.&#xD;
      Pre-clinical candidates&#xD;
      have now been developed and are being actively commercialised [9].&#xD;
    Domainex' success has merited a number of awards, including the&#xD;
      Innovation in Enabling&#xD;
      Biotechnology Prize at the UKTI Bioentrepreneurial Company of the Year&#xD;
      Awards (2009) and the&#xD;
      2010 Genesis Life Science Innovation and Enterprise Programme of the Year&#xD;
      Award.&#xD;

    The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) founded the spin out company&#xD;
      Domainex in 2002 in&#xD;
      collaboration with UCL and Birkbeck. The company was set up on the basis&#xD;
      of novel research into&#xD;
      the expression of soluble protein domains to provide services to a range&#xD;
      of bioscience-based&#xD;
      companies. Within the period 2008-2013, Domainex has established&#xD;
      profitability and positioned&#xD;
      itself as a successful company employing over 30 scientists at its&#xD;
      laboratories in Cambridge. It has&#xD;
      established programmes and contracts with over 20 international clients in&#xD;
      medicinal chemistry,&#xD;
      drug discovery, monoclonal antibody development and agrochemical science,&#xD;
      making a major&#xD;
      commercial impact in all these fields.&#xD;

    Establishing the spin out company Domainex to exploit novel protein&#xD;
        expression technology&#xD;
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Biological Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>&#xD;
    Early in 1999, Professor Laurence Pearl, who was then at UCL, initiated a&#xD;
      research project to&#xD;
      identify and express soluble protein domains derived from full-length&#xD;
      protein macromolecules in&#xD;
      order to facilitate drug discovery and other applications. In July 1999,&#xD;
      following the appointment of&#xD;
      Pearl (ICR Faculty, 1999-2010) and his UCL colleague Dr Chris Prodromou&#xD;
      (ICR Senior Staff&#xD;
      Scientist, 1999-2010) to the ICR, their research team took the lead in&#xD;
      progressing the protein&#xD;
      domain project in collaboration with Professor Paul Driscoll of UCL and Dr&#xD;
      Renos Savva of&#xD;
      Birkbeck. Throughout, Pearl led the project and most of the research work&#xD;
      was conducted at the&#xD;
      ICR.&#xD;
    The exploitation of potential new protein targets &amp;#8212; for drug and vaccine&#xD;
      development, for the&#xD;
      development of novel agrochemicals and for the generation of new&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies &amp;#8212;&#xD;
      usually requires sizeable quantities of soluble proteins for&#xD;
      high-throughput screening and structure-based&#xD;
      development. However, in many cases, recombinant expression of full-length&#xD;
      proteins is&#xD;
      problematic, and identification of soluble subconstructs is a slow trial&#xD;
      and error process that is often&#xD;
      unsuccessful.&#xD;
    The Pearl team developed a fast and effective, high-throughput approach&#xD;
      for the identification of&#xD;
      soluble protein domains, which they named combinatorial domain hunting&#xD;
      (CDH) (Ref 1). In&#xD;
      essence, CDH combines a method for the production of unbiased,&#xD;
      finely-sampled gene-fragment&#xD;
      libraries with a screening protocol that provides 'holistic' readouts of&#xD;
      solubility, ligand binding and&#xD;
      yield for thousands of protein fragments.&#xD;
    To further the technological development and commercial exploitation of&#xD;
      CDH, the ICR founded a&#xD;
      spin out company, Domainex, in 2002, in partnership with UCL and Birkbeck&#xD;
      and with Pearl as&#xD;
      Chief Scientific Officer of the company. Under the leadership of Pearl,&#xD;
      the academic research&#xD;
      teams continued to work with Domainex to develop the technology further&#xD;
      and to facilitate service&#xD;
      contracts.&#xD;
    The first CDH proof of principle study was carried out using a&#xD;
      multidomain protein, the p85&amp;#945;&#xD;
      subunit of class I PI3 kinase. Research over many years by a number of&#xD;
      international teams had&#xD;
      empirically defined the domain architecture of this protein. In contrast,&#xD;
      with CDH it took less than&#xD;
      twelve months to successfully identify stable, soluble and highly&#xD;
      expressed protein segments&#xD;
      encapsulating the known domains (Ref 2). Similarly, using the CDH&#xD;
      approach, the Pearl team was&#xD;
      able to study another target which was historically difficult to express,&#xD;
      human MEK-1. They&#xD;
      identified a fragment which covers the kinase domain of MEK-1 and&#xD;
      expresses and crystallises&#xD;
      significantly better than designed expression constructs. The crystal&#xD;
      structure of this fragment was&#xD;
      reported, explaining some of its superior properties (Ref 3).&#xD;
    The CDH technology has been developed further by the Pearl team working&#xD;
      with their Domainex&#xD;
      partners, resulting in the publication of the `CDH squared' method. This&#xD;
      method addresses the&#xD;
      additional structural complexity of protein-protein interactions, enabling&#xD;
      the rapid elucidation of&#xD;
      stable protein-protein core complexes. The HSP90/CDC37 complex was used as&#xD;
      a first proof of&#xD;
      principle of this new technique (Ref 4). The research began at ICR, but&#xD;
      was completed after Pearl&#xD;
      and Prodromou had relocated to the University of Sussex.&#xD;

    The ICR has made a major impact on the international search for&#xD;
      inhibitors of PKB, a key signalling enzyme and a target for the&#xD;
      development of cancer therapeutics. This research has enabled a number of&#xD;
      pharmaceutical companies to advance their research programmes for the&#xD;
      development and commercialisation of novel drugs: currently, seven novel&#xD;
      PKB inhibitors are in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), two of which&#xD;
      are from the joint ICR and Astex PKB drug discovery programme.&#xD;
    Impacts on health&#xD;
    Two distinct drugs discovered by ICR and Astex are progressing&#xD;
          through clinical trials in the UK and overseas; patients are&#xD;
          benefiting by participating in these trials.&#xD;
    The ICR has discovered two series of PKB inhibitors in a collaborative&#xD;
      research programme with Astex. As a result, one series was licensed in a&#xD;
      commercial agreement with AstraZeneca and the lead drug, AZD5363, is&#xD;
      currently undergoing clinical trials at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust (RM), The Christie (Manchester), the NKI (Netherlands) and in Japan,&#xD;
      involving a total of over 400 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers:&#xD;
      NCT01226316, NCT01353781, NCT01625286, NCT01692262, NCT01895946) [1]. The&#xD;
      ICR has led on the first trial of AZD5363 and Dr Udai Banerji (ICR&#xD;
      Faculty) gave an oral presentation at AACR 2013 summarising its exciting&#xD;
      potential in the clinic in selected patients. Results of the first phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial of AZD5363 have reported both partial responses and stable&#xD;
      disease in patients harbouring mutations in PIK3CA or AKT1. This therefore&#xD;
      identifies these mutations as potential predictive biomarkers of response&#xD;
      for AZD5363. The lead compound of the second series, AT13148, which is&#xD;
      being developed by Astex, has different properties and could be useful in&#xD;
      a distinct patient group. This drug is also in clinical trial at RM,&#xD;
      enrolling 40 patients with advanced solid tumours (ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      Identifier: NCT01585701) [2].&#xD;
    Impacts on commerce&#xD;
    The international PKB drug discovery effort has been facilitated by&#xD;
          ICR's work to solve the crystal structure.&#xD;
    The ICR solved the PKB crystal structure and published this work&#xD;
      (Research Refs 1 and 2 above) and in total, over 30 international&#xD;
      commercial companies, including many major pharmaceutical companies, have&#xD;
      cited the influence of these publications in their own publications (17&#xD;
      commercial companies have cited Ref 2 since 1 January 2008). This shows&#xD;
      that this work had an important impact on their in-house research&#xD;
      investment and endeavour (data from Web of Science). For example, since&#xD;
      2008 GSK has made major investment into developing PKB inhibitors as novel&#xD;
      therapeutics. Its lead product, GSK2110183, progressed into Phase II&#xD;
      clinical trials in 2009. GSK cited Reference 2 in their&#xD;
      publications [3, 4].&#xD;
    Two distinct drugs discovered by ICR and Astex are being&#xD;
          commercially developed&#xD;
    The drugs AZD5363 and AT13148, derived from chemical series discovered by&#xD;
      ICR and Astex, are being developed by AstraZeneca and Astex, respectively.&#xD;
      Both are in clinical trial. This has a commercial benefit to both these&#xD;
      companies by adding to their development pipeline and therefore increasing&#xD;
      shareholder value.&#xD;
    Industry is investing in pre-clinical research and clinical&#xD;
          research to develop PKB inhibitors in the UK (including at ICR and RM)&#xD;
          and overseas.&#xD;
    AstraZeneca and Astex are investing in the clinical research of AZD5363&#xD;
      and AT13148 respectively by conducting clinical trials. These drugs are&#xD;
      based on the chemical series discovered by the ICR. Companies such as GSK&#xD;
      that have cited ICR's underpinning research are investing in clinical&#xD;
      research worldwide (ClinicalTrials.gov lists several GSK2110183 clinical&#xD;
      trials, for example NCT01428492, NCT01531894, NCT01532700 and NCT01653912)&#xD;
      and seven novel PKB inhibitors are now being developed.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    PKB (protein kinase B), also known as AKT, is an enzyme in the PI3&#xD;
      kinase/mTOR intracellular signalling pathway, which is deregulated in many&#xD;
      cancers. Professor David Barford's team at the ICR solved the crystal&#xD;
      structure of PKB03b2 using innovative protein engineering. The ICR has&#xD;
      licensed six international pharmaceutical companies with reagents to&#xD;
      enable them to begin PKB drug discovery programmes. The Barford team has&#xD;
      also used their structural biology expertise to advance the ICR's own PKB&#xD;
      inhibitor drug discovery programme. Two series of inhibitors were&#xD;
      developed that were licensed to AstraZeneca and Astex and are now both in&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;

    Professor David Barford (ICR Faculty) and his team published the results&#xD;
      of research, conducted between 1999 and 2002 in collaboration with a team&#xD;
      at the Friedrich Miescher Institute, on the crystal structure of the&#xD;
      enzyme PKB03b2 (also known as AKT2) (Refs 1 and 2). PKB was known to be a&#xD;
      key enzyme in the PI3 kinase/mTOR signalling pathway and is itself&#xD;
      mutated, overexpressed or amplified in certain cancers. As such it is a&#xD;
      potential target for anti-cancer drugs, but development of inhibitors of&#xD;
      PKB had been hindered by the lack of protein structural information. By&#xD;
      the early 2000s, it had been established that PKB is activated by two&#xD;
      phosphorylation events. While it was known that PDK1 phosphorylates&#xD;
      Thr309, the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Ser474 in the&#xD;
      hydrophobic motif had not been identified. Thus, there was no procedure&#xD;
      for generating activated PKB in vitro. The method of introducing a&#xD;
      sequence based on 'PIFtide' to mimic the structural consequences of Ser474&#xD;
      phosphorylation circumvented the need to phosphorylate Ser474, allowing&#xD;
      the Barford team to produce activated PKB for structural, biochemical and&#xD;
      functional studies. The innovative protein engineering used in the design&#xD;
      of the phospho-Ser474 mimetic constituted a major breakthrough in the&#xD;
      field. The ICR made the expression systems encoding the engineered protein&#xD;
      widely available to commercial companies and academic researchers.&#xD;
    The Barford team then collaborated with ICR Cancer Therapeutics teams led&#xD;
      by Dr Michelle Garrett (ICR Faculty, UoA1), Professor Paul Workman (ICR&#xD;
      Faculty, UoA1), Dr Ian Collins (ICR Faculty, UoA1) as lead chemist and Dr&#xD;
      Suzanne Eccles (ICR Faculty, UoA1). They began an in-house drug discovery&#xD;
      research programme in 2002, aimed at finding ATP competitive inhibitors of&#xD;
      PKB. In 2003, the ICR team began a collaboration with the UK company Astex&#xD;
      on this research programme. One innovative approach that the Barford and&#xD;
      Astex teams used was fragment based lead discovery (Ref 3). Another&#xD;
      innovative approach was a "back-soaking" method for obtaining&#xD;
      PKB03b2-ligand crystal structures (Ref 4).&#xD;
    Two fragment hits from the PKB screen were elaborated using&#xD;
      structure-based design and medicinal chemistry based on the Barford&#xD;
      protein structure information. Half of these medicinal chemistry research&#xD;
      studies and the majority of the biological research studies were&#xD;
      undertaken at the ICR, and these helped to validate PKB as a potential&#xD;
      oncology target. Each of the two hits led to the identification of a lead&#xD;
      chemical series and a number of publications resulted (Yap et al, 2012,&#xD;
      Clin Cancer Res 18, 3812-3823 and McHardy et al, 2010, J Med Chem 53,&#xD;
      2239-2249). One chemical series was licensed to AstraZeneca. The second&#xD;
      series was retained by Astex; this chemical series is distinct from the&#xD;
      first as it has a broader specificity and inhibits other AGC kinases,&#xD;
      which could contribute usefully to anticancer activity. In particular it&#xD;
      has potent Rho kinase activity and a biologically distinct profile (Yap et&#xD;
      al, 2012, Clin Cancer Res, 18, 3812-3823).&#xD;

    The ICR's HSP90 research programme has had significant impacts on health&#xD;
      and on commerce.&#xD;
    ICR research has validated HSP90 as a drug target and identified&#xD;
      biomarkers to be used in clinical trials. This work was published, so that&#xD;
      pharmaceutical companies worldwide could use the public domain information&#xD;
      to develop their own in-house drug discovery programmes and more than 20&#xD;
      novel HSP90 inhibitors are now in clinical trials.&#xD;
    The ICR independently discovered the pyrazole resorcinol series of HSP90&#xD;
      ATP competitive inhibitors and then entered into a research collaboration&#xD;
      with the UK biotechnology company Vernalis to optimize this chemical&#xD;
      series further in order to identify a clinical candidate. Later Vernalis&#xD;
      licensed the programme to Novartis, who adopted the ICR/Vernalis clinical&#xD;
      candidate, named it AUY922 and took it into clinical trials worldwide.&#xD;
    Impacts on Health&#xD;
    &#xD;
      AUY922, a novel HSP90 inhibitor discovered by the ICR, is now&#xD;
        progressing through clinical trials in the UK and internationally, and&#xD;
        some of the Phase II trials have now been completed. Since 2008, many&#xD;
        patients have participated in these trials (4 trials with 89 patients&#xD;
        have been completed and 18 trials with estimated enrolment of 845&#xD;
        patients are ongoing); the drug has a good safety profile and there is&#xD;
        preliminary evidence of efficacy (20-30% response rate in breast and&#xD;
        non-small cell lung cancer with positive Phase II data by objective&#xD;
        RECIST criteria in both diseases). The most promising, advanced trials&#xD;
        so far include phase II clinical studies in patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
        breast cancers which have become resistant to the commonly used antibody&#xD;
        drug trastuzumab (Herceptin), and also in patients with non-small cell&#xD;
        lung cancer who have become resistant to the widely used drugs erlotinib&#xD;
        and crizotinib, which target two tumour pathways driven by EGFR and ALK,&#xD;
        the protein products of which require HSP90 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Research&#xD;
        Ref 6 above].&#xD;
      The ICR validated HSP90 as a potential cancer target and provided&#xD;
        intellectual leadership (in parallel with Memorial Sloan-Kettering and&#xD;
        NCI). This encouraged other pharmaceutical companies to develop novel&#xD;
        drugs and recruit patients into clinical trials. Over 20 novel HSP90&#xD;
        inhibitors are now in clinical trials [6]. Over 15 international&#xD;
        pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have cited the ICR's published&#xD;
        research in this field (Web of Science data).&#xD;
      The ICR developed novel pharmacodynamic biomarkers that are being used&#xD;
        internationally in clinical trials of HSP90 inhibitors. Use of these&#xD;
        biomarkers demonstrates target engagement and increases the rational&#xD;
        basis for proceeding with treatment and reduces the risk of later&#xD;
        attrition. Research Ref 5 above has been cited 280 times and by more&#xD;
        than 7 international companies (Web of Science data).&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Impacts on Commerce&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Vernalis has received substantial licence fee and milestone payments&#xD;
        from Novartis as a result of the HSP90 deal. This has helped Vernalis to&#xD;
        continue to employ UK staff at its facilities in Cambridge and Reading.&#xD;
        Vernalis' Interim Results report 29th July 2013 states that&#xD;
        AUY922 is one of the operational highlights and that the company's&#xD;
        collaboration income has been growing [7].&#xD;
      Vernalis has added shareholder value by having AUY922 in its pipeline&#xD;
        [7, 8].&#xD;
      Novartis has added shareholder value by having AUY922 in its pipeline.&#xD;
        A Novartis investor report listed AUY922 as one of its potential&#xD;
        blockbusters (Novartis 2nd quarter 2011 results and a&#xD;
        Novartis R&amp;amp;D Investor Day presentation lists accelerating AUY922&#xD;
        development as a planned key activity in 2013-14 [9].&#xD;
      Industry has invested in HSP90 research. Novartis and other&#xD;
        pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials of HSP90&#xD;
        inhibitors. There are 90 clinical trials of HSP90 inhibitors listed on&#xD;
        the National Institute of Health Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, with a&#xD;
        conservative estimate of an excessive of 5,000 patients treated with&#xD;
        these inhibitors worldwide.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    HSP90 is a key molecular chaperone protein, and cancer cells are&#xD;
      particularly dependent on its function. However, given its wide-ranging&#xD;
      action, many doubted it would be possible to produce an effective and safe&#xD;
      HSP90 inhibitor. Multidisciplinary research at the ICR has validated HSP90&#xD;
      as an oncology target and defined useful biomarkers leading to HSP90&#xD;
      currently being one of the most actively pursued targets in the drug&#xD;
      industry. ICR's own drug candidate, AUY922, was licensed to Novartis and&#xD;
      is now in late stage clinical trials. It has shown promising therapeutic&#xD;
      activity, especially in HER2-positive breast and non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancers, including drug resistant cases. HSP90 inhibitors could be used&#xD;
      against a wide range of other cancers including breast, lung, prostate,&#xD;
      ovarian and colon.&#xD;

    Chaperones are proteins that assist the folding, stability and activity&#xD;
      of "client" proteins and the assembly or disassembly of other&#xD;
      macromolecular structures. HSP90 is a key chaperone protein, particularly&#xD;
      important in cancer cells, and therefore a potential target for novel&#xD;
      therapeutics. However, given its wide-ranging action, many doubted it&#xD;
      would be possible to produce an effective and safe HSP90 inhibitor.&#xD;
    ICR's first significant contribution to the HSP90 field was made by Dr&#xD;
      Lloyd Kelland (ICR Faculty, 1990-2002) and Professor Paul Workman (ICR&#xD;
      Faculty since 1997). They demonstrated that 17-AAG; a natural&#xD;
      product-based HSP90 inhibitor developed by the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI), which was the first agent to enter the clinic, had a major&#xD;
      metabolic toxicity and drug resistance liability and was unlikely to be a&#xD;
      useful drug (Ref 1). 17-AAG is no longer being developed because of its&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
    Professor Laurence Pearl (ICR Faculty, 1999-2010) and Dr Chris Prodromou&#xD;
      (ICR Staff Scientist, 1999-2010) had published the first accurate crystal&#xD;
      structure of HSP90 in 1997. At ICR, they began a collaboration with a drug&#xD;
      discovery team led by Professor Workman with the objective of using the&#xD;
      protein structure to help discover novel and effective HSP90 synthetic&#xD;
      small-molecule inhibitors which were competitive at the critical ATP site.&#xD;
    HSP90 drug discovery at ICR began with a primary screen against the yeast&#xD;
      enzyme and then the team developed an innovative counter screen for&#xD;
      testing against the human enzyme; this secondary assay was based on ICR's&#xD;
      discovery and functional elucidation of the co-chaperone Aha1 (Ref 2).&#xD;
      Using these screening assays in conjunction with; structure-based design,&#xD;
      medicinal chemistry and tumour biology models, the ICR team discovered the&#xD;
      pyrazole resorcinol series of HSP90 inhibitors (Ref 3). AUY922, the novel&#xD;
      drug that is now undergoing clinical trials, is based on this resorcinol&#xD;
      series.&#xD;
    In 2002, the ICR began a research collaboration with the UK company&#xD;
      Vernalis. The two teams continued to optimize the ICR's pyrazole&#xD;
      resorcinol series using structure-based design and medicinal chemistry&#xD;
      both at ICR and Vernalis. The majority of the biological research studies&#xD;
      were undertaken by the research team led by Workman at ICR and these&#xD;
      provided important validation of HSP90 as a useful oncology target (Ref 4)&#xD;
    From their optimisation of the pyrazole resorcinol series, the&#xD;
      ICR/Vernalis team identified a potential clinical candidate. In 2004&#xD;
      Vernalis licensed the ICR/Vernalis HSP90 programme to Novartis, and&#xD;
      Novartis adopted the clinical candidate identified by ICR and Vernalis&#xD;
      (AUY922) (Ref 4). AUY922 is now in Phase II trials worldwide.&#xD;
    ICR has provided intellectual leadership for clinical trials of novel&#xD;
      HSP90 inhibitors. Professor Ian Judson, an ICR faculty member, led this&#xD;
      clinical programme. ICR, together with its clinical partner the Royal&#xD;
      Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (RM), began this work by conducting trials of&#xD;
      17-AAG. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00003969 and NCT00104897). These pioneering&#xD;
      studies led to the first clinical demonstration of the detailed molecular&#xD;
      signature of HSP90 inhibition and established that HSP90 inhibitors could&#xD;
      be delivered safely.&#xD;
    ICR and RM have also played a central role in the clinical testing of&#xD;
      ICR's drug AUY922 (Ref 6). The first phase I trial at ICR and RM, led by&#xD;
      Dr Udai Banerji (ICR Faculty), demonstrated proof-of-concept for target&#xD;
      engagement and inhibition of tumour metabolism (FDG-PET). Two key phase II&#xD;
      trials of AUY922 have been completed, showing promising activity in breast&#xD;
      and non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

    The ICR has made a major impact on the international search for&#xD;
      inhibitors of PKB, a key signalling enzyme and a major target for the&#xD;
      development of cancer therapeutics. This is a significant impact in&#xD;
      enabling a number of pharmaceutical companies to advance their research&#xD;
      programmes for the development and commercialisation of novel drugs.&#xD;
      Currently seven novel PKB inhibitors are in clinical trial&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov), two of which are from the joint ICR and Astex PKB&#xD;
      drug discovery programme.&#xD;
    Impacts on health&#xD;
    Two distinct drugs discovered by ICR and Astex Pharmaceuticals are&#xD;
          progressing through clinical trials in the UK and overseas; patients&#xD;
          are benefiting by being able to participate in these trials.&#xD;
      ICR has discovered two series of PKB inhibitors in a collaborative&#xD;
      research programme with Astex Pharmaceuticals. As a result, one series was&#xD;
      licensed in a commercial agreement with AstraZeneca and the lead drug,&#xD;
      AZD5363, is currently undergoing clinical trials at RM, The Christie&#xD;
      (Manchester), the NKI ( Netherlands) and in Japan, involving a total of&#xD;
      over 400 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT01226316,&#xD;
      NCT01353781, NCT01625286, NCT01692262, NCT01895946) [1]. The ICR has led&#xD;
      on the first trial of AZD5363 and Dr Udai Banerji (ICR Faculty, from 2007)&#xD;
      gave an oral presentation at AACR 2013, summarising its exciting potential&#xD;
      in the clinic and reporting for the first time clinical responses in&#xD;
      patients whose tumours had PIK3CA and AKT mutations. This&#xD;
      highlights the fact that this drug has potential applications in a wide&#xD;
      range of solid tumours including breast and gynaecological cancers.&#xD;
      Results of the first Phase I clinical trial of AZD5363 have reported both&#xD;
      partial responses and stable disease in patients harbouring mutations in&#xD;
      PIK3CA or AKT1. This therefore identifies these mutations as potential&#xD;
      predictive biomarkers of response for AZD5363. The clinical development&#xD;
      candidate from the second series, AT13148, which is being developed by&#xD;
      Astex Pharmaceuticals, has biological properties distinct from other PKB&#xD;
      inhibitors and could be useful in a different patient group. This drug is&#xD;
      also in clinical trial at RM (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01585701,&#xD;
      estimated enrolment 40 patients) [2].&#xD;
    Worldwide, clinical trials of PKB inhibitors are being facilitated&#xD;
          by the ICR's work to define useful biomarkers and make protocols&#xD;
          generally available.&#xD;
      The ICR was a key site in the first clinical studies of the Merck&#xD;
      inhibitor MK-2206 (Research Ref 5 above) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:&#xD;
      NCT00670488) through its identification of clinical pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      biomarkers to monitor PKB inhibition, thus facilitating all PKB programmes&#xD;
      worldwide. In some cases these PD markers also have utility in trials of&#xD;
      other drugs, such as PI3K inhibitors. Protocols have been made available&#xD;
      for these biomarker assays. Companies that have licensed the protocols&#xD;
      (for a fee) include Quintiles and Boehringer Ingelheim. So far, six&#xD;
      international pharmaceutical companies have cited this key publication&#xD;
      (Research Ref 5 above) in work describing their PKB inhibitor programmes&#xD;
      (data from Web of Science) [3, 4].&#xD;
    Impacts on commerce&#xD;
    Two distinct drugs discovered by ICR and Astex Pharmaceuticals are&#xD;
          being commercially developed.&#xD;
      The drugs AZD5363 and AT13148, derived from chemical series discovered by&#xD;
      the ICR and Astex Pharmaceuticals, are being developed by AstraZeneca and&#xD;
      Astex Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Both are in clinical trial. This has&#xD;
      a commercial benefit to both these companies by adding to their&#xD;
      development pipeline and therefore increasing shareholder value.&#xD;
    Results of the first Phase I clinical trial of AZD5363 have reported&#xD;
      partial responses in patients harbouring mutations in PIK3CA or AKT1.&#xD;
      This highlights the fact that these drugs have potential single agent&#xD;
      activity in solid tumours. Multiple clinical trials of combinations of&#xD;
      AZD5363 are currently ongoing and in planning to maximize its potential in&#xD;
      a wide range of cancers.&#xD;
    As stated above, the international PKB drug discovery effort has been&#xD;
      facilitated by the ICR's structural biology and pharmacodynamic biomarker&#xD;
      studies. In addition to the benefit to patients, this has also had&#xD;
      commercial impact, as a number of pharmaceutical companies have added PKB&#xD;
      programmes to their pipelines. For example, since 2008 GSK has made a&#xD;
      major investment into developing PKB inhibitors as novel therapeutics. Its&#xD;
      lead product, GSK2110183, progressed into Phase II clinical trials in&#xD;
      2009.&#xD;
    Industry is investing in pre-clinical research and clinical&#xD;
          research to develop PKB inhibitors in the UK (including at the ICR and&#xD;
          RM) and overseas.&#xD;
      AstraZeneca and Astex Pharmaceuticals are investing in the clinical&#xD;
      research of AZD5363 and AT13148 respectively by conducting clinical&#xD;
      trials. These drugs are based on the chemical series discovered by the&#xD;
      ICR. Companies such as GSK that have cited the ICR's underpinning research&#xD;
      are investing in clinical research worldwide (ClinicalTrials.gov lists&#xD;
      several GSK2110183 clinical trials eg: NCT01428492, NCT01531894,&#xD;
      NCT01532700 and NCT01653912), and seven novel PKB inhibitors are now being&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Protein kinase B (PKB), also known as AKT, is an enzyme in the PI3&#xD;
      kinase/mTOR intracellular signalling pathway, which is found to be&#xD;
      deregulated in many forms of cancer. Professor David Barford's team at the&#xD;
      ICR solved the crystal structure of PKB03b2 using innovative protein&#xD;
      engineering and licensed six international pharmaceutical companies with&#xD;
      reagents to enable them to begin PKB drug discovery programmes. The ICR&#xD;
      also initiated its own PKB drug discovery programme: two series of&#xD;
      inhibitors were developed that were licensed to AstraZeneca and Astex and&#xD;
      are now both in clinical trial. The ICR's work helped to establish PKB as&#xD;
      a valid cancer therapeutic target. The ICR is involved in clinical&#xD;
      research studies of multiple PI3 kinase and PKB inhibitors, and this&#xD;
      research has led to the definition of useful clinical pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

    Professor David Barford (ICR faculty member, UoA5) and his team published&#xD;
      the results of research, conducted between 1999 and 2002, in collaboration&#xD;
      with a team at the Friedrich Miescher Institute, on the crystal structure&#xD;
      of the enzyme PKB03b2 (also known as AKT2, (Yang et al, 2002, Nat. Struct.&#xD;
      Biol. 9, 940-944)). PKB was known to be a key enzyme in the PI3&#xD;
      kinase/mTOR signalling pathway and is overexpressed, mutated and amplified&#xD;
      in certain cancers and as such it was a potential target for anti-cancer&#xD;
      drugs. Before the Barford team published the crystal structure of PKB03b2,&#xD;
      the development of inhibitors of PKB had been hindered by the lack of&#xD;
      protein structural information.&#xD;
    Using the Barford crystal structure information, ICR Cancer Therapeutics&#xD;
      teams led by Dr Michelle Garrett (ICR Faculty), Professor Paul Workman&#xD;
      (ICR Faculty), Dr Ian Collins (ICR Faculty) as lead chemist and Dr Suzanne&#xD;
      Eccles (ICR Faculty), began an in-house drug discovery research programme&#xD;
      in 2002, which in 2003 became a collaboration with the UK company Astex&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, and used their virtual screening technology and high&#xD;
      throughput crystallography technology. The programme aimed at finding ATP&#xD;
      competitive inhibitors of PKB.&#xD;
    Two fragment hits from the PKB virtual screen were elaborated using&#xD;
      structure-based design and chemistry based on the Barford protein&#xD;
      structure information. The chemistry research was a collaboration between&#xD;
      the ICR and Astex Pharmaceuticals with Collins taking a lead role for the&#xD;
      ICR, which undertook half the medicinal chemistry research on this&#xD;
      project. The majority of the biological research studies were undertaken&#xD;
      at the ICR, and these helped to validate PKB as a potentially useful&#xD;
      oncology target. Each of the two hits led to the identification of a lead&#xD;
      chemical series, and a number of publications resulted (Refs 1-4). One&#xD;
      chemical series (Refs 2-4) was licensed to AstraZeneca. The second series&#xD;
      was retained by Astex Pharmaceuticals; this chemical series is distinct&#xD;
      from the first as it has a broader specificity and inhibits other AGC&#xD;
      kinases, which could contribute to anticancer activity (Ref 1). In&#xD;
      particular it has potent Rho kinase activity and a biologically distinct&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
    The ICR and its partner institution The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation&#xD;
      Trust (RM) has also contributed to the PKB field through its clinical&#xD;
      research. The first PKB inhibitor to enter the clinic was the Merck&#xD;
      product (MK-2206), an allosteric inhibitor; the ICR and the RM were&#xD;
      involved in the Phase I studies of this compound (Ref 5). The ICR led the&#xD;
      way in developing clinical pharmacodynamic biomarkers for monitoring&#xD;
      target engagement and the response of patients to PKB inhibitors (Ref 5).&#xD;
      These biomarkers measure if the target is being inhibited, demonstrating&#xD;
      `target engagement'. This research included the establishment of a novel&#xD;
      method for monitoring PKB target engagement in hair (eyebrow) follicles&#xD;
      and platelet rich plasma (PRP) as surrogate tissues, and was successfully&#xD;
      implemented in multiple clinical trials (ref MK2206 trial, e.g.&#xD;
      NCT00670488). Subsequently, both the hair follicle and PRP PD assays have&#xD;
      been applied to Phase I clinical trials of multiple PI3 kinase and PKB&#xD;
      inhibitors, including AZD5363 and AT13148, which both arose from the ICR&#xD;
      PKB drug discovery programme.&#xD;

    Research on coloured glass forms the basis of impact on the social&#xD;
      enterprise Ten Green Bottles&#xD;
      (TGB) [5.7], a company based in New Radnor (Powys), that uses recycled&#xD;
      glass to make a variety&#xD;
      of products including jewellery, tableware and stained glass artefacts,&#xD;
      thus providing innovative&#xD;
      and interesting uses for recycled glass. As part of its mission to secure&#xD;
      a more sustainable future&#xD;
      by reducing the amount of waste glass, TGB also aims to provide employment&#xD;
      opportunities for&#xD;
      individuals that would normally be excluded from the workplace, for&#xD;
      example those with learning&#xD;
      difficulties and mental health issues.&#xD;
    The collaboration between DMAP and TGB includes a jointly-funded KESS PhD&#xD;
      project that&#xD;
      contributes to the use of coloured glass in TGB's products, such as the&#xD;
      development of a solar&#xD;
      water heater made from recycled glass. The connection between the&#xD;
      fundamental research on&#xD;
      colour centres and the optical properties of the recycled glass (and&#xD;
      simple analogues) allows the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the heat transfer of solar radiation to be optimised.&#xD;
      Here a fundamental and&#xD;
      practical understanding of the optical and thermal properties of the&#xD;
      recycled glass is required; this&#xD;
      is coupled with advanced thermal and fluid-flow modelling, a level of&#xD;
      expertise and insight that has&#xD;
      not been previously available to this small company. Thus the KESS&#xD;
      partnership acts as an&#xD;
      enabler for impact as it enhances the level of communication between DMAP&#xD;
      researchers and&#xD;
      TGB.&#xD;
    Ten Green Bottles is able to benefit directly from access to DMAP&#xD;
      research into glasses and&#xD;
      liquids, which has enabled new processes and products to be developed. As&#xD;
      the CEO of Ten&#xD;
      Green Bottles acknowledges in a letter to one of the key DMAP researchers,&#xD;
      it is because of the&#xD;
      SME's `interaction with [DMAP that they have] been able to&#xD;
        benefit from direct access to physics&#xD;
        research' which has `provided an opportunity [...] to enhance&#xD;
      [TGB's] current business and also the&#xD;
        potential to develop new products, specifically the development, design&#xD;
        and manufacturing of solar&#xD;
        water heaters, made from recycled glass' [5.1] Thus the DMAP&#xD;
      research makes a major&#xD;
      contribution to the `tangible, economic advantage' [5.1]&#xD;
      acknowledged by Ten Green Bottles.&#xD;
    As a social enterprise, Ten Green Bottles has a direct and positive&#xD;
      impact on the community in&#xD;
      south Powys and its regeneration. In its capacity as one of the UK's&#xD;
      Community Interest&#xD;
      Companies (CIC), TGB offers workshops that allow participants to make&#xD;
      their own piece of&#xD;
      recycled glass, thus gaining an understanding of the process and&#xD;
      benefiting from the SME's&#xD;
      knowledge [5.2]. Ten Green Bottles CIC is also a recognised training&#xD;
      centre that offers community&#xD;
      members the opportunity to gain qualifications and to develop work skills,&#xD;
      which creates benefits&#xD;
      for socially challenged individuals as well as the long-term unemployed.&#xD;
      TGB's website states that&#xD;
      `previous trainees have been very successful with a high percentage&#xD;
        acquiring long term&#xD;
        employment after their time here.' [5.3]. It is therefore vital for&#xD;
      Ten Green Bottles to continually gain&#xD;
      further insight `into the atomic scale structure of their aesthetically&#xD;
        pleasing materials' [5.1]. The&#xD;
      CEO of Ten Green Bottles also states that `The research and development&#xD;
        into coloured glasses&#xD;
        not only provides [the] social enterprise with a strong&#xD;
        commercial foundation but in a wider sense&#xD;
        will provide [the SME] with the knowledge and insight into the&#xD;
        use of recycled materials such that&#xD;
      [Ten Green Bottles] can contribute and inform the sustainability and&#xD;
        environmental debate' [5.1].&#xD;
    Including socially challenged individuals as well as student volunteers,&#xD;
      the diversity of Ten Green&#xD;
      Bottles' workforce underscores the SME's CIC mission which is promoted&#xD;
      through a number of&#xD;
      events including presentations and visits to other countries. This is&#xD;
      exemplified in the SME's recent&#xD;
      visit to the Czech Republic, which proved beneficial to one of the student&#xD;
      volunteers. As part of its&#xD;
      mission Ten Green Bottles is `pleased to offer a forum for students to&#xD;
        understand business with&#xD;
        social values and enterprise that is sustainable.' [5.1]. It is&#xD;
      through its ties with academic&#xD;
      researchers, strengthened by the KESS studentship that contributes to the&#xD;
      knowledge transfer&#xD;
      between DMAP and Ten Green Bottles, that the SME can be `recognised as&#xD;
        having research&#xD;
        innovation and design at the heart of [their] business'&#xD;
      [5.1]. Considering Ten Green Bottles' efforts&#xD;
      to support those who work for the SME, a major success of the knowledge&#xD;
      transfer between DMAP&#xD;
      and Ten Green Bottles is that it `introduced [Ten Green Bottles'] workforce&#xD;
        and volunteers to&#xD;
        academia and extended their ambitions to higher education.' [5.1]&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    This case study describes the impact of physics research, carried out in&#xD;
      the Department of&#xD;
      Mathematics and Physics (DMAP), on the small business and social&#xD;
      enterprise Ten Green Bottles&#xD;
      through the development of specific commercial applications, transfers of&#xD;
      technology, and the&#xD;
      development of new products. Fundamental research on the atomistic origin&#xD;
      of the structural and&#xD;
      optical properties of recycled and synthetic coloured glass has provided&#xD;
      an opportunity for Ten&#xD;
      Green Bottles to gain an economic advantage. The collaboration between&#xD;
      DMAP and Ten Green&#xD;
      Bottles benefits the enterprise's workforce, whose educational ambitions&#xD;
      have been extended&#xD;
      through the interaction with DMAP research, and also benefits the local&#xD;
      community, whose&#xD;
      understanding of physics research has been enhanced through their&#xD;
      interaction with Ten Green&#xD;
      Bottles.&#xD;

    As part of the materials research programme into glass and glass-forming&#xD;
      liquids at Aberystwyth,&#xD;
      started by Greaves [3.1] in 1996, a programme of study has been developed&#xD;
      focussing on coloured&#xD;
      glass. The broader research programme into glass, glass-forming liquids&#xD;
      and amorphous materials&#xD;
      at Aberystwyth University involves the use of neutron and high energy&#xD;
      X-ray diffraction. The&#xD;
      structures of liquids and glasses change under extremes of temperature and&#xD;
      pressure and new&#xD;
      techniques (high flux, high energy X-rays and aerodynamic levitation [3.2,&#xD;
      3.3]) have been&#xD;
      developed to allow a connection to be made between transient metastable&#xD;
      structures and&#xD;
      structure-dependent properties such as viscosity. This connection also&#xD;
      allows the local&#xD;
      environment around colour centres to be established.&#xD;
    Although coloured glasses have been available for centuries, a detailed&#xD;
      understanding of the&#xD;
      physics of colour is a more recent development. The colour reflects the&#xD;
      local environment around&#xD;
      transition metal ions (crystal-field effects) or nanophase gold or silver&#xD;
      particles. Coloured glasses&#xD;
      are beneficial in many applications because they are cheap, they contain&#xD;
      no organic material, the&#xD;
      colour centres are dispersed throughout the glass host and the glass hosts&#xD;
      themselves are&#xD;
      sufficiently robust to be able to withstand climatic and radiative&#xD;
      extremes [3.4]. Coloured glasses&#xD;
      are therefore of interest in a variety of applications, including their&#xD;
      potential to be used as&#xD;
      calibration targets for the ExoMars 2016 and 2018 missions; this is the&#xD;
      subject of an on-going&#xD;
      interdisciplinary research programme between DMAP and the Department of&#xD;
      Computer Science at&#xD;
      Aberystwyth University [3.5].&#xD;
    The optical properties of these glasses that provide strong colour can be&#xD;
      measured and modelled&#xD;
      using spectroscopic techniques and X-ray absorption measurements and this&#xD;
      is one focus of a&#xD;
      Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship (KESS) established between DMAP and&#xD;
      the social&#xD;
      enterprise Ten Green Bottles (TGB) in 2011, in which TGB sponsor a current&#xD;

    UK based Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc is the world's second-largest
      manufacturer of jet engines in
      wide body civil aircraft [A], in competition with the largest industrial
      company in the world and US
      defence contractor, GE. It is the only non-US based company with
      significant operations in this
      sector and employs 42,800 people worldwide with 22,800 based in the UK
      [B]. Manufacture of civil
      aerospace jet engines generated revenue of &amp;#163;6,437M in 2012 with &amp;#163;727M of
      underlying profit for
      Rolls-Royce [B]. Rolls-Royce is one of the UK's largest manufacturing
      exporters, with 75% of its
      revenue coming from overseas [C]. Rolls-Royce, unsurprisingly, wish to
      retain competitive
      advantage, hence their interest in research that will a) reduce the
      probability of blade failure and b)
      allow a 10K higher operating temperature that saves fuel and reduces
      emissions. The impact of
      our research lies in two key areas:
    1. The microstructure of nickel superalloys: casting,
          porosity, grain orientation and creep
          prediction
    Nickel superalloys are used in the manufacture of jet engines blades due
      to their excellent
      mechanical strength and resistance to creep (tendency for solids to slowly
      move or deform under
      stress) at high temperatures; good surface stability; and corrosion and
      oxidation resistance.
      Optimising these properties via composition or manufacturing process is
      key to the successful
      manufacture and sale of jet engines and to the continual improvement of
      fuel efficiency in aircraft.
      Because of the significant fuel cost and CO2 savings realised,
      they are replaced every 10,000 h
      (around every 2 years). Relatively high volume manufacturing of these
      blades is therefore essential
      and the cost of manufacture has a significant impact on airline service
      costs and aero engine
      manufacturer profitability. The optimisation of properties is achieved
      through the reduction or
      elimination of crystal grain boundaries (i.e. single crystal growth) and
      the appropriate selection of
      the grain orientation to reduce deformation (creep) from the centrifugal
      stresses in the engine. This
      is exactly what the research insights outlined in section 2 allows one to
      control.
    The FIB-SIMS work has also been helpful in understanding the mechanisms
      of high temperature
      oxidation of the melt and its interaction with the mould wall. This has
      enabled casting surface scale
      to be tackled, allowing larger single crystal castings to be used in new
      engines at an economically
      acceptable cost without suffering from excessive scrap rates.
    The FIB-SIMS technique development has also enabled the role of Y in bond
      coats to be quantified
      in follow-up work at Imperial. These are the interlayers that act as Al
      reservoirs and diffusion
      barriers between the metallic blade and the insulating ceramic thermal
      barrier coatings. This has
      enabled improved PtAl-based bond costs to be implemented in production,
      enabling further life/
      temperature improvements to be achieved.
    A Materials Technologist at Rolls-Royce Plc notes:
      "the research collaboratively with Imperial College addressed the
        mechanism for the formation of
        stray grains ... [and] was instrumental in the design of a novel grain
        selector that successfully
        enables the "filtering" of these stray grains and ensuring casting
        conformance. This has resulted in
        publications in peer reviewed journals...as well as two granted patents
        for the grain selector....The
        collaboration with Imperial College has been important in identifying
        the role of the as-cast oxide
        that forms during solidification and that plays a crucial role during
        solutioning." [D].
    Quantitative Estimate of the impact
      Scrap rates in the production of these type of blades due to
      non-conformance in 1993 were ~50%
      and are now reduced to ~10%. This improvement leads to a ~&amp;#163;300m/yr savings
      in waste material
      and processing (based on a cost per blade of &amp;#163;100 and typical production
      rates). A lower bound on
      Imperial's contribution to this of 5% gives a saving of &amp;gt;&amp;#163;100m over the
      last decade attributable to
      the casting research. The ability to grow single crystals with an improved
      yield made it
      economically feasible to manufacture larger single crystal castings,
      leading to the ability to raise
      turbine entry temperatures, which impacts on fuel burn and consequently
      fuel cost and CO2
      emissions, improving competitiveness. A 10K increase in temperature
      capability equates to about
      0.5% increase in fuel efficiency. A Rolls Royce specialist in nickel
      alloys notes that:
      "It has been estimated that an increase in compressor discharge
        temperature of 30C produces
        0.3% less specific fuel consumption per engine. For a large twin engine
        aircraft flying from London
        to New York, a 0.3% SFC equates to a 700kg reduction in fuel
        consumption, which translates to a
        reduction of ~2.25tonnes of CO2 emissions per flight." [E]
    The 2012 estimated fuel costs of the airline industry were $210bn, and as
      Rolls-Royce has ~40%
      of the market their increased temperature capability allows a saving of
      $420m/year in fuel, or 2.6
      million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This reduction in running
      costs makes Rolls-Royce engines
      attractive to airlines and has allowed the company to grow its market
      share. The improvement in
      10K material capability and the subsequent saving of $420m/yr can be
      assigned to developments
      across Ni superalloy research. The importance of this improved casting
      process has had a
      significant impact on the fortunes of Rolls-Royce Plc - this was
      highlighted in an Economist article
      on April 21st 2012, which states:
    "But some things are not for sharing because they are too important to
        preserve a product's
        competitive advantage. For Rolls-Royce, turbine blades are one of those
        key technologies. The
        magic that creates them depends on a deep understanding of materials
        science and production
        technology. When metals solidify after casting they normally contain
        lots of microscopic crystals.
        That would still leave them strong enough for most things, but it is a
        potential weakness in a
        turbine blade. So Rolls-Royce uses a unique system which casts the blade
        in a nickel-based
        super-alloy with a continuous and unbroken crystalline structure. This
        ensures there will be no
        structural defects." [F]
    2. FIB SIMs: O interstitials in titanium
    The compressor and fan blades of a jet engine are made of titanium alloys
      because of their
      superior density-normalised fatigue strength. Hollow fan blades are made
      by diffusion bonding and
      vacuum brazing processes that can be difficult to control. As near-final
      manufacturing processes
      they are impossible to non-destructively inspect and therefore any
      variability must be tightly
      controlled. This has been enabled by the techniques developed by Shollock
      and used by Dye to
      understand and help improve the production process. A Rolls-Royce Fellow
      provides details of fuel
      consumption savings and CO2 emissions and explains how oxygen diffusion
      measurements and
      the development of an algorithm to predict the thickness of oxidation
      damage as a function of time
      and temperature were "beneficial to Rolls-Royce plc."
    "The use of FIB SIMS depth profiling of interstitials in `good' and
        `bad' microstructures enabled the
        root cause for variability in the manufacturing process to be defined as
        nucleation driven from
        surface topography rather than via a chemistry change. ... Whilst the
        benefit associated with this
        work is difficult to quantify in direct financial terms, the
        manufacturing changes are being
        implemented in order to reduce the probability of fan blade failures in
        service. The direct cost to the
        company is ~&amp;#163;5M per failure event."[G]
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Rolls-Royce has been able to reduce manufacturing scrap rates
      significantly, better control the
      single crystal growth process for nickel superalloy blades and more
      confidently understand
      production issues in Ti blades. The lower bound saving for the Imperial
      contribution to the work is
      estimated at &amp;#163;100M p.a. This has contributed to the production of a jet
      engine with better fuel
      efficiency, increased cost effectiveness due to lower scrap rate and
      improved time on wing for
      fleets in service.
    Jet engine modifications account for over half the fuel efficiency
      improvements in modern aircraft,
      with the industry accounting for a large share of UK visible exports.
      Improvements in gas turbine
      technology offer jet fuel (cost and CO2) savings and support UK
      employment. Titanium alloys in
      the cooler sections and nickel alloys in the hot sections are the subject
      of this case study.
    The engines consist of Ti or Ni alloy discs attached to a series of
      shafts which are turned by
      aerofoils (blades) in the gas stream. Incoming air is accelerated by the
      fan section then
      compressed, mixed with fuel and burned, with the energy then being
      extracted by the turbine.
      Turbine blades operate in a gas stream at 1800+ K, 200 K greater than the
      alloy melting point, and
      extract up to 700 kW per blade to power the fan and compressor. Each disc
      holds around 60
      blades, with around 9 turbine stages in a large engine. In titanium,
      failure of a fan blade or multiple
      blades is extremely costly (&amp;#163;5M per event) and of course poses safety
      issues. Research in the
      Department has focussed on a) predicting the microstructure of nickel
      superalloys and b)
      understanding defect formation in titanium and superalloys.

    The Department of Materials at Imperial College London carries out a
      large body of research in the
      area of solidification and microstructural analysis of alloys. The
      specific research insights that have
      had significant impacts on the science and technology of jet engines are
      as follows.
    1. Predicting the microstructure of nickel superalloy blades:
        porosity, grain orientation and
        the effect on creep
    With the support of an EPSRC Grant GR/L05433/01 (Dec 1996-Sept 2000) Dr
      Shollock and
      Professor McLean investigated the effects of well-controlled directional
      solidification conditions on
      the microstructures of nickel-base superalloys. The combination of
      controlled directional
      solidification and detailed crystallographic characterisation provided the
      most comprehensive
      information at that time on the correlation of solidification conditions
      with microstructure.
      Specifically it was found that:
    
      increasing the solid-liquid interface allowed better grain orientation
        control,
      stability of grains depended on their orientation and
      minor differences in alloy composition can affect the stabilisation of
        grains [1].
    
    In follow-on work in 2002/3, led by Professors McLean with Lee and
      supported by Rolls Royce,
      Special Metals Wiggin and Wyman-Gordon, a combined cellular
      automaton-finite difference (CA-FD)
      model was developed to simulate the solidification process. It was found
      that for nickel
      superalloys the dendrite spacing selection (achieved by branching and
      dendrite competition)
      exhibited hysteresis. It was found that perturbation of the growth
      velocity affects both the primary
      dendrite arm spacing and tip undercooling - the primary dendrite arm
      spacing has a much narrower
      distribution after perturbation. The upper limit of the distribution of
      primary dendrite arm spacing is
      about twice the lower limit. Thus, the primary spacing was found to be
      dependent not only on the
      current growth conditions, but also on the way in which those conditions
      were reached [2].
      These research findings were successful in allowing model-based casting
      design to be employed,
      so as to minimise stray grain formation and to control primary and
      secondary orientation in single
      crystal castings. Extension of this work was carried out with EPSRC grant
      EP/R78992/019
      (Oct2002-Mar2006) led by Professor Lee and Dr Dye, which introduced a
      methodology (weighted
      interval rank sort) that allowed the spatial variation of composition
      (microsegregation) to be more
      accurately estimated [3]. In linked work Professor Lee also determined
      that porosity was a major
      crack initiator and large pores close to the surface played an important
      role determining the fatigue
      life of cast components. It was established that the average size of pores
      as well as their spatial
      and size distribution in a component are also important. A statistical
      model was developed which
      successfully predicted fatigue life due to porosity population [4].
    In 2006 research resumed on creep in superalloys, based on the historical
      activity in this area by
      Professor McLean, using support from an EPSRC platform grant, GR/T26344/01
      (Feb 2005-Jan2010)
      and a further grant, EP/C536312/1 (Oct 2005- 2009). Of specific relevance
      is the
      development of a truly physically-based model by Dr Dye allowing the
      features of superalloy creep
      to be recovered i.e. dependence upon microstructure and its scale, effect
      of lattice misfit, internal
      stress relaxation, incubation phenomena and the interrelationship of
      tertiary and primary creep,
      and vacancy condensation leading to damage accumulation. The model
      provided predictive
      capability of the microstructural factors accounting for creep.
    2. FIB-SIMs, O interstitials and degradation of alloys
    Dr Shollock developed a combination of O isotope exchange, focussed ion
      beam milling and
      secondary isotope mass spectrometry (FIB-SIMS) in the late 90s, primarily
      to develop insight into
      the oxidation mechanisms of nickel superalloys [5][6]. This allowed depth
      profiling of O at the
      nanoscale, elucidating the mechanisms by which multi-layer and multi-phase
      oxide scales grow, in
      what order and understanding which are truly protective. In addition
      insight was gained into the
      formation processes of the brittle intermetallics in the secondary
      reaction zone and the porosity
      (vacancy accumulation) at the interfaces. More recently, this has been
      extended to the use of FIB-SIMS
      to measure and quantify interstitial concentration profiles in titanium
      alloys, in a PhD thesis
      published in 2013 "Controlling the interstitial element concentration in
      Ti-6Al-4V using
      Calciothermic Reduction" by Moorhouse (supervised by Dr Shollock). It was
      determined that with
      careful selection of the FIB-SIMS parameters one could correctly quantify
      the interstitial
      concentrations in titanium alloys and obtain oxygen concentration
      profiles.

      Grimes' work on nuclear fuel performance and waste behaviour, in
        particular on radiation damage of nuclear materials (references 1 and 2)
        has led to him becoming arguably the UKs leading nuclear scientist
        (sources A,B). He was part, as the nuclear expert, of a UK
        industry/academia delegation to India in 2010 led by the Prime Minister
        David Cameron. During the Fukushima incident in 2011 he was called upon
        to be a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE),
        providing the science advice to the Cabinet Office Briefing Room A
        (COBRA), on issues such as the state of the reactors and the safety of
        UK nationals. Subsequently, he was appointed a member of the Office of
        Nuclear Regulation's Technical Advisory Panel reporting to the Secretary
        of State (2011) on the implications for the UK nuclear industry of the
        Fukushima nuclear accident.
      Grimes' fundamental understanding of nuclear issues (e.g. references
        1-3) and his civil nuclear leadership (sources B and C) also resulted in
        Rolls-Royce placing a University Technology Centre (UTC) in Nuclear
        Engineering at Imperial, of which he is founding Director. Rolls-Royce
        regards this UTC as playing a central role in the development of its new
        civil nuclear business. He was the Specialist Advisor to the House of
        Lords Science and Technology Committee (HoLSTC) for its 2011 enquiry and
        report on Nuclear R&amp;amp;D Capabilities which highlighted the urgent need
        for fundamental change in the way that nuclear research is conducted in
        the UK. This led to his appointment in March 2012 to the UK Government
        Nuclear Research and Development Advisory Board chaired by the
        Government Chief Scientific Advisor, which reported to Government early
        2013 advising on the development of a long-term nuclear energy strategy.
        Lee was appointed Specialist Advisor to the HoLSTC for their 2013
        follow-up to the 2011 report on Nuclear R&amp;amp;D Capabilities.
      Grimes was a member of the Royal Society Working Group on Nuclear
        Non-Proliferation, which generated the report Fuel Cycle Stewardship in
        a Nuclear Renaissance (source A) and subsequently co-chaired the
        discussion meeting Nuclear Energy in the 21st Century. In his
        supporting letter (source B) the Chairman of the UKAEA emphasises Grimes
        "vital role for the progress of nuclear physics, nuclear engineering and
        nuclear materials activities in the UK as expert technical advisor to
        the HoLSTC you were instrumental in guiding their Lordships to a hard
        hitting report on the status of Nuclear R&amp;amp;D in the UK and the need
        for a clearly defined and substantial R&amp;amp;D programme to underpin the
        new Nuclear Build.....". Grimes's and Lee's influence was clearly
        demonstrated in the recent report of the Ad Hoc Nuclear R&amp;amp;D
        Advisory Board chaired by the Government chief scientific adviser (CSA)
        with Grimes as member (source C) which made several recommendations to
        Government including the setting up of a National Nuclear R&amp;amp;D
        Advisory Board, a National Nuclear Users Facility and a strong programme
        of R&amp;amp;D in support of geological disposal all of which the Government
        has begun to put in place (source D). Grimes has been working with the
        Foreign and Commonwealth Office Science and Innovation Team promoting UK
        nuclear research capabilities, particularly in India (leading to an
        EPSRC-India portfolio of joint projects) and SE Asia, and was appointed
        Chief Scientific Advisor to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Feb.
        2013.
      Lee's unique understanding of the processing and durability of
        vitreous and ceramic waste forms (references 4-6) gave him the expertise
        to be appointed CoRWM Deputy Chair in Oct 2007. CoRWM has since had a
        major influence on the Government's &amp;#163;multi-billion MRWS programme via
        its scrutiny and advice role to DECC (specifically the Energy Minister
        and Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change) and the Nuclear
        Decommissioning Authority (NDA). Lee lead the CoRWM R&amp;amp;D Group form
        2007-13 and met regularly with the research leaders of the NDA, RWMD,
        NNL, Sellafield Sites, EdF Energy, RCUK (EPSRC/NERC) offering formal and
        informal scrutiny and advice. This culminated in the CoRWM R&amp;amp;D
        Report (2009) whose 6 key recommendations (source E) were reported to
        the HoLSTC (source F) and where possible at this stage in the MRWS
        programme, have mostly been accepted and acted upon by Government.
        Specifically, his work on the concept of glass composite materials
        (reference 4) had led to the UK now developing such waste forms through
        development work at Sellafield Sites plc using thermal methods such as
        plasma melting to host some of the ill-defined wastes in the Sellafield
        Legacy Ponds and Silos. These represent the biggest threat to UK
        security and cost &amp;#163;70M/annum just to keep in their current state.
      As an example, the first CoRWM recommendation (source E) on improved
        coordination of the UKs radwaste R&amp;amp;D programme led directly to
        changes to the NDAs Research Board while another recommendation
        influenced the process by which outside users can access the NNLs active
        facilities. As CoRWM Deputy Chair Lee had regular meetings with the CEO
        of the NDA, the DECC Chief Scientific Advisor, the Energy Minister, the
        Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change as well as leading
        civil servants in the DECC nuclear team. These meetings influenced
        Government waste management policy specifically in the repository
        volunteerism process, additional support from RCUK for waste R&amp;amp;D and
        greater participation in international programmes.
      In his supporting letter (source G) the CoRWM Chair highlights
        reference 4 as one of the reasons for Lee's appointment to CoRWM and
        lists areas where CoRWM's R&amp;amp;D Report had influence including in "the
        establishment of an Advisory Board on Nuclear R&amp;amp;D, chaired by the
        Government Chief Scientific Advisor, with a remit that includes R&amp;amp;D
        related to management of legacy and new build radioactive wastes".
      CoRWM also does a significant amount of public engagement and this has
        led to several radio appearances and work with public and other
        stakeholders in the UK (source H) and abroad (e.g. Bure, France).
        Grimes' high media profile (source H) and TV/radio appearances during
        the Fukushima accident were responsible for the UK public remaining
        positive about the nuclear option (source B).

    Through strategic national roles Grimes and Lee have had a major impact
      on the expansion of the UKs nuclear R&amp;amp;D programme since 2000 and on
      directing Government policy in the nuclear sector. Their research led
      directly to appointments to influential positions including (Grimes) as
      Specialist Advisor Nuclear to the House of Lords Science and Technology
      Committee (HoLSTC) for their report on Nuclear R&amp;amp;D Capabilities and
      (Lee) as Deputy Chair of the Government Advisory Committee on Radioactive
      Waste Management (CoRWM), which has a major scrutiny and advice role to
      Government's &amp;#163;multi-billion Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS)
      programme reporting directly to the Energy Minister. Due to his unique
      insight in nuclear engineering Grimes is now Chief Scientific Adviser to
      the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

    Influence on UK Government's Nuclear R&amp;amp;D Programmes and Policy

    Imperial College has a long-established world-leading position in nuclear
      materials with emphasis on understanding how to develop nuclear fuel
      performance predictions, processing, structure and design and durability
      of glass, glass composite and ceramic waste forms.
    Grimes has worked on fuels and modelling at Imperial College since 1995
      and as Professor since 2002. His work (e.g. reference 1) led to a
      fundamental understanding of the underlying physical processes that
      control key performance properties such as fission gas retention and
      thermal conductivity. He has been the international leader in predicting
      how fission products behave in fuel for over 20 years and was recently the
      first to publish papers on dislocations in fuel, which control creep of
      fuel during reactor operation. This industry focus led to sponsorship from
      British Energy (now EdF Energy), Westinghouse and most recently the
      Rolls-Royce Nuclear University Technology Centre (UTC). Equivalent work in
      ceramic waste form performance and radiation damage behaviour has resulted
      in collaborations and sponsorship from Los Alamos National Laboratory and
      the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). His
      work has identified radiation tolerant ceramic waste host materials and
      ensembles of phases (reference 2) for composite waste forms, including the
      first predictions of glass-crystal interface structures and partition of
      fission products between phases. Grimes has unequivocally demonstrated the
      central role that modelling and simulation must play in the development of
      nuclear materials. His publication of articles such as that in Science
      (reference 3) provide a technical assessment of current and future reactor
      and fuel cycle options for the UK specifically but also globally, thereby
      outlining direction for the development of nuclear energy.
    Lee's research has provided unique understanding of the processing and
      durability of vitreous and ceramic nuclear waste forms (references 4-6).
      Specifically, his work on the concept of glass composite materials
      (reference 4) highlighted the potential for waste form materials between
      the ostensibly completely amorphous glass waste hosts (such as the
      borosilicate glasses used by the UK and France for their High Level
      Wastes, HLWs) and fully crystalline ceramic waste forms (such as Synroc,
      Synthetic Rock now marketed by ANSTO). References 4 and 5 developed
      fundamental understanding of the various mechanisms for crystal formation
      in simulant HLW glasses and led to the concept of making durable waste
      forms containing crystals. Previously it had been assumed the presence of
      such crystals would inevitably be detrimental to the waste forms
      durability. Reference 6 used this understanding to demonstrate the
      application of glass composite materials to a significant UK waste stream
      and that the resulting waste form was durable. Large volumes of difficult,
      ill-defined, radioactive wastes at sites such as Sellafield and Hanford in
      the USA have led to this sensible engineering approach being adopted
      worldwide.

    Dissemination of the impact
      From the research highlighted in section 2, Prof. Iwata's team was able to
      present a collection of new crystallization screening kits; MemStart,
      MemSys, MemGold and MemPlus. These kits were exclusively commercialized by
      UK company Molecular Dimensions between 2002 and 2008, via Imperial
      Innovations, under license from Imperial College [A]. They were some of
      the first screens available to the research community and are now
        "widely acknowledged as the gold standard as the starting point for
        membrane protein crystal growth" [A].
    The nature of the impact
      The current screens sold by Molecular Dimensions, underpinned by Imperial
      research, are MemStart, MemSys, MemGold, and MemPlus, which range from
      between &amp;#163;75 to &amp;#163;300 per unit [B, C]. [text removed for publication].
      Managing Director of Molecular Dimensions, Tony Savill, stated that "the
        impact [of the solution kits] is not only manifested in sales but also
        in our ability to attract other collaborators with methods that can be
        commercialised and thus serve to continually build on the range of
        products we can offer for membrane protein research" [B].
    These products have been sold to many industrial organisations and
      academic institutions across the world (see the beneficiaries section for
      the names). This research has benefited the whole scientific community in
      the field of membrane protein structural biology at worldwide scale, and
      Molecular Dimensions benefitted financially with the exclusive
      commercialization of the screens. Savill adds that "the research
        carried out by So Iwata's group and the successes they have achieved is
        followed in the literature all over the world and other membrane protein
        research scientists are eager to use their successful methods. It has
        led to Molecular Dimensions being recognised as the leading company in
        providing new products for this challenging sector" [B].
    Beneficiaries
      Molecular Dimensions is the main disseminator of the product, and
      consequently the first beneficiary. With the exclusive commercialization
      of the screens, Molecular Dimensions is being recognised as the leading
      company in providing new products for this challenging sector. The
      products are sold all over the world with 52% sold in North America, 26%
      in Europe and 21% in Asia to both world-leading academic institutions and
      the pharmaceutical industry. [text removed for publication], who are
      working on membrane protein drug targets [B].
    The significance
      Membrane proteins perform a variety of functions in our body and more than
      50% of commercially available drugs target these membrane proteins.
      Therefore, structural information of membrane proteins plays a vital role
      in medicine and in pharmaceutical drug discovery programs. The field of
      structure-based drug design is a rapidly growing area in which many
      successes have occurred in recent years. The explosion of genomic,
      proteomic, and structural information of membrane proteins has provided
      hundreds of new targets and opportunities for future drug discovery. The
      method is now routinely used in the pharmaceutical industry. It is
      difficult to evaluate the economic impact of the particular screens
      because they are used in a complicated drug discovery cycle. It is,
      however, certain that our products strengthen the UK pharmaceutical
      industry (see the list of the companies using the kits above), which
      contributed &amp;#163;8.4 billion to the UK's GDP and invested a total of &amp;#163;3.9
      billion in research and development in 2007.
    Date of the impact
      The impacts occurred from 2008 onwards, when the screens were exclusively
      commercialized by Molecular Dimensions, under license from Imperial
      College.
    Today, with the increasing number of membrane protein structures, updated
      information has been used to design new solution kits that should prove
      useful for both initial crystallization scouting and subsequent crystal
      optimization. These new screens are also commercialized by Molecular
      Dimensions under the license of Oxford University [D, E].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research carried out within Imperial's Life Sciences department led to a
      collection of new kit solutions to screen the crystallisation conditions
      of various membrane proteins. These screens were exclusively
      commercialized by Molecular Dimensions, a UK company, in 2002, 2003 and
      2008 under license from Imperial College London. They are the primary
      screening kit in membrane protein crystallization that is commercially
      available. These screens have helped to screen the crystallization
      conditions of a wide range of membrane proteins, leading to many new
      structures. Molecular Dimensions has sold [text removed for publication]
      screens, worth more than [text removed for publication], to both academia
      and industry all over the world.

    4 &amp;#8212; Overcoming a major bottleneck in structural biology: the development
      and commercialization of innovative membrane protein crystallization
      screens
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Biological Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    The results of genome sequencing projects have shown that up to 30% of
      human proteins occur in cell membranes. Membrane proteins play crucial
      roles in many biological functions, including the capture of energy from
      sunlight by plants, the use of energy in cells, and the movement of
      molecules across cell membranes. They are particularly important in
      medicine, since over 50% of commercially available drugs (such as
      antihistamines, beta blockers, antipsychotic drugs, morphine) target
      membrane proteins. We need to understand membrane protein structures to
      provide a basic understanding of life at the molecular level and for
      computer-aided rational design of new drugs, which could reduce the number
      of animal experiments and unwanted side effects. X-ray crystallography is
      currently the most successful method for determining the three-dimensional
      structure of membrane proteins. To determine medically relevant membrane
      protein structures more efficiently, we have established the Membrane
      Protein Laboratory at the UK synchrotron radiation facility, the Diamond
      Light Source, as an Imperial College outstation by combining recently
      developed high throughput technologies for protein crystallisation and the
      state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction data collection system. Nevertheless,
      growing the crystals required for this technique remains as one of the
      major bottlenecks in this area of structural biology. This is especially
      true for membrane proteins that are of particular interest due to their
      medical relevance.
    To address this problem, a team of Imperial scientists, Dr. Simon
      Newstead, Dr. Sebastian Ferrandon and Dr. Elizabeth Carpenter, under the
      supervision of Prof. Iwata, has undertaken a detailed analysis of the
      crystallization conditions from all membrane protein structures deposited
      in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The PDB contains the information,
      including crystallization conditions, for all published
      protein-structures. Recent research successes have significantly increased
      the numbers of high-resolution membrane protein structures using X-ray
      crystallography. A sufficient amount of data is now available in the PDB
      on successful membrane protein crystallization to allow the rational
      design of a more specific crystallization screen. With this aim in mind,
      we constructed a database of crystallization information of membrane
      proteins that were crystallized using the vapor diffusion technique, the
      most commonly used method for initial crystal screening. This information
      has been analyzed so that the success of different parameters can be
      easily compared for different membrane protein families. Main parameters,
      which we found critical for successful crystallisation, are detergent
      selection, types of precipitant, types of buffers and pH ranges, types and
      concentrations of salts and additives. Based on this analysis, we created
      a series of new screening solution kits for membrane protein
      crystallization [1,2].
    Imperial College and Molecular Dimensions collaborated closely to
      commercialize the screens MemStart (2002), MemSys (2003), MemGold (2008)
      and MemPlus (2008) under license from Imperial College. Dr Jeanette Hobbs
      and Mrs Davina Jordan from Molecular Dimensions also played a crucial role
      for the commercialization of these products. Today, these screens are
      widely used in membrane protein crystallization. Many membrane protein
      structures have now been solved using these products (for example, [3-6]).

    There have been several important development stages undertaken by the
      Imperial College group, all with strong industrial interaction and product
      feed through, that has led to the commercial and academic success of the
      all-fibre integrated supercontinuum source. Before our seminal publication
      in 2004 there were no commercial supercontinuum sources with visible
      radiation capability, although our infra-red system of 1997, which was
      commercialized by IPF Technology, did have the capability but required
      external frequency doubling and this was not available as a commercial
      add-on.
    The high power supercontinuum source has had significant impact on
      various fields from time resolved spectroscopy, imaging and remote sensing
      and most certainly has been a commercial success. The major beneficiaries
      have been manufacturers of the fibre based product: high power,
      supercontinuum fiber lasers are now sold by commercial laser companies
      such as Fianium (UK), NKT Photonics (Denmark) and Toptica (Germany and
      USA). Devices have been available from 2006, but visible spectral coverage
      was limited. Our research publications showing how short wavelength
      spectral extent of the supercontinuum was linked to long wavelength loss,
      e.g. [6], and our demonstrations illustrating mitigation of this effect
      and allowing short wavelength extension to the blue have led to commercial
      devices operating throughout the complete visible spectrum with high
      spectral power density. Impact has been made on the commercial devices
      which are now truly "white light", in fact covering practically the
      complete window of transmission of optical fibre. Minimizing the IR loss
      allowed manufacturers to introduce simpler fibre structures and improve
      the performance and specification of commercial products.
    The best example of a commercial Yb fibre MOPFA-powered, fully integrated
      supercontinuum source incorporating photonic crystal fibre is exemplified
      by the Fianium product line [A]. The Whitelase supercontinuum sources
      provide "a spectrum from below 390nm to beyond 2400nm, enabling
        applications such as fluorescence imaging, broadband spectroscopy,
        optical coherence tomography (OCT), and time-correlated single-photon
        counting" [B]. In a letter Fianium states the important contribution
      of J.R. Taylor's group, and in particular publication [4], to the "development
        of commercial supercontinuum fiber lasers". It confirms that "the
        current installed base of supercontinuum fiber lasers is approximately
        1000 units worldwide and this follows directly from pioneering research
        conducted by Professor J.R. Taylor's group. With our current devices
        being priced at between &amp;#163;12,000 and &amp;#163;80,000, this number of sales
        represents a significant impact on the commercial development of the
        market" [C]. In 2012 Fianium, which has headquarters in Southampton
      and offices in the US, Europe and Asia, won the Queen's Award for
      Enterprise in the Innovation Award category for the development of the
      Whitelase Supercontinuum Fibre laser [D].
    The Danish company NKT Photonics offers a range of commercial
      supercontinuum lasers under the SuperK brand. Their SuperK Extreme
      supercontinuum lasers "represent the next generation of supercontinuum
        lasers that are truly turn key with industry leading brightness covering
        the entire 400-2400nm wavelength range" [E] and "with more than
        8W of total power and 2W of visible power, the SuperK EXTREME lasers are
        the brightest supercontinuum lasers on the market" [F]. The SuperK
      Extreme laser "covers a broad range of applications such as
        Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM), Optical Coherence Tomography
        (OCT), Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC), F&amp;#246;rster Resonance
        Energy Transfer (FRET), Flow cytometry, DNA sequencing, White Light
        Inteferometry (WLI), Test and Measurement and many others" [E]. In a
      letter NKT Photonics confirms the key role the Imperial group played in
      the research and development of fiber based supercontinuum sources, in
      particular paper [4]. It also confirms the effect of this on the products
      it offers: "this basic configuration of the all-fibre integrated
        scheme, pumped by a MOPA...provided as inspiration for commercial high
        power supercontinuum sources, several types and models which [the]
        company produces" [G]. Users of the SuperK product include Leica
      Microsystems, Germany, the RECENDT Research Centre for Non Destructive
      Testing GmbH, Austria, and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany
      [H].
    Important to the further simplification and power scaling was the
      realization by us that continuous wave fibre lasers could be employed for
      supercontinuum generation as opposed to the general consensus that
      efficient nonlinear optics required high peak powers. This was achieved
      through a complete understanding of the non-linear processes controlling
      supercontinuum generation, in particular modulational instability that
      initiates it and the process of soliton-dispersive wave interaction that
      mediates long and short wavelength extension. The potential for
      commercialization was acknowledged through the award of a Royal Society
      Brian Mercer Feasibility Award in 2008 [I]. Through this we have looked at
      the complete simplification of the supercontinuum source, minimizing the
      number of components in order to produce a very commercially competitive
      device. IPG Photonics have "indicated [their] willingness to support
        the commercialization of this in collaboration with Prof Taylor's group"
      [J]. The Feasibility Award has now ended and the potential
      commercialization of the technology is on-going.
    Following the commercial success of high power supercontinuum sources,
      J.R. Taylor from the Imperial College group, in collaboration with
      Professor J.M. Dudley at the University of Franche-Comte, was commissioned
      to prepare a commercially successful research text "Supercontinuum
      Generation in Optical Fibers", Cambridge University Press, ISBN
      978-0-521-51480-4 (2010). In the first year since publication this text
      book has sold 460 copies.
    Additionally, during the period of this impact assessment, our pioneering
      work in developing the systems and clarifying the underlying science and
      technological challenges has been recognized in the field through 21
      invited talks (solely on high power supercontinuum generation) at the
      major international conferences incorporating Industrial Trade Shows where
      commercial supercontinuum sources were exhibited. For example at
      Biophotonics '11 (Sweden), International Conference on Laser Optics 2010
      (Russia), The Latin American Optics &amp;amp; Photonics Conference (Brazil),
      International Conference on Materials &amp;amp; Advanced Technologies
      (Singapore), Asia Optical Fiber Communications &amp;amp; Optoelectronics
      Exposition and Conference (China). Fianium confirm that the "many
        international conference presentations delivered by Professor J.R.
        Taylor and members of his group have helped stimulate significant
        world-wide interest and demand for commercial supercontiuum products"
      [C].
    The beneficiaries of our research span all fields as a direct result of
      the diverse applications of the high power supercontinuum source. These
      devices have been directly cascaded into research and imaging diagnostics,
      with primary application in health care as well as in the biomedical
      research base. According to Antonoly Grudinin, CEO of Fianium Ltd, "Ultrafast
        fiber lasers in general and super-continuum sources in particular have
        good prospects to become a key technology in biomedical applications"
      [K].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The development of a high average power, all-fibre integrated,
      supercontinuum (or "white light") source, has led to a completely new
      product that has had significant commercial impact on the fibre laser and
      applications market place. The basic science, the technologically
      important power scaling and all-fibre integration were undertaken and
      first demonstrated by Imperial College staff. This device is currently
      sold as a compact free standing device by companies such as Fianium, NKT
      Photonics and IPG Photonics. Sales of supercontinuum lasers at Fianium
      alone have greatly exceeded &amp;#163;10M. The device has also been successfully
      incorporated into spectroscopic and medical imaging instrumentation
      generating new business activity through this disruptive technological
      change.

    The concept of the "supercontinuum" is not new. Spectral broadening in
      lasers or external to the laser cavity as a result of nonlinearity has
      been identified and utilized since the late 1960s. However, no commercial
      devices were developed simply because of the unwieldy experimental
      configurations and the instability and irreproducibility as a result of
      lens focussing into the nonlinear medium. With the appearance of low loss
      optical fibre in the 1970s control of nonlinearity became simpler and more
      reliable yet lens coupling from bulk lasers prohibited commercial
      development of supercontinuum sources.
    A major step in the miniaturization, power scaling and reliability of
      fundamental pump sources came with the development of the all fibre master
      oscillator power fibre amplifier scheme or MOPFA [1]. This was an
      experimental technique that was pioneered and developed by the Imperial
      College group in collaboration with IPG Photonics, the world's largest
      manufacturer of fibre laser and amplifier based instrumentation, in the
      mid-1990s. By 1997, the group in collaboration with IPG Photonics
      developed an extremely compact moderate average power (1W) supercontinuum
      source [2] that was commercialized by IPF Technology in the UK, a spin-off
      company from IPG Photonics and led by ex-Imperial College Physics
      Department personnel. This device was not a "white light" source, instead
      utilizing soliton-Raman cascading, a technique developed by the Imperial
      College group, to cover the near infra-red range from 1000nm to 2300 nm.
    With the introduction of photonic crystal fibre at the end of the 1990s
      and the demonstration of supercontinuum generation in that medium
      utilizing a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser, interest was renewed in
      supercontinuum generation and the potential of "white light" generation.
      These latter systems were identical to the earlier schemes of the 70s and
      80s in their experimental configurations, exhibiting instability and low
      average power levels of only a few milliwatts with little chance of
      spectral power increase.
    The quantum jump in supercontinuum sources was undertaken by the Imperial
      group in 2002 [3]. The post deadline report in 2004 at the prestigious
      international Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (paper CPDC7,
      Conference on Lasers and Electro Optics, CLEO 2004) described the fully
      integrated all fibre supercontinuum source incorporating a picosecond Yb
      MOPFA with photonic crystal fibre as the non-linear platform [e.g. 2] drew
      academic and commercial interest alike. The spectral power density was
      three orders of magnitude greater than could be achieved with Ti:Sapphire
      lasers and the construction was compact, reliable, reproducible and
      completely hands free. In 2003 details of the construction were passed to
      Fianium in the UK, a manufacturer of pulsed fibre lasers.
    During the period of the current REF consideration, we have further
      developed the source power-scaling by more than another order of magnitude
      [3, 4] and solved the problem of extension of the supercontinuum to
      blue/UV spectral region [5, 6]. We identified that limitations to short
      wavelength extension were caused by long wavelength loss and confirmed
      that control of soliton-dispersive wave interactions were vital for short
      wavelength extension [4]. This is implemented either through tapering of
      the nonlinear PCF fibre or by controlling and lowering the loss in the
      manufacture process or it can also be solved by simple power-length
      scaling.

    Following the underpinning research at Imperial College that led to the
      demonstration of a family of
      high average power, fibre-based lasers operating throughout the visible
      and the near infra-red,
      impact has been identified and acknowledged by the commercialization of
      the developed systems
      and in the application of the lasers in diverse medical treatments.
    From 2006 to 2010 Dr Popov College held a Royal Society Industrial
      Research Fellowship, which
      was undertaken in association with IPG Photonics. During this time and in
      collaboration with Dr
      Popov, the IPG group of companies undertook the commercial development of
      several of the high
      power fibre laser systems that had been researched at Imperial College, in
      particular, the (i)
      frequency doubled Yb and Yb:Er fibre lasers, (ii) MOPFA type fundamental
      and frequency doubled
      Raman fibre lasers and (iii) the Thulium based system operating around
      2&amp;#181;m. In a letter, IPG
      Photonics confirms that in "we established a mutually beneficial
        programme to investigate the
        frequency doubling of Yb based MOPFAs (master oscillator power fibre
        amplifiers) in periodically
        poled materials. The thrust of that programme was to use controlled seed
        signals from laser diodes
        or fibre lasers and to amplify these to moderately high average powers,
        in the many tens of watts
        regime, before efficient frequency doubling in various poled crystals.
        The programme was very
        successful and deploying Yb, Er and Raman based amplifiers in various
        formats, tuneable red,
        green, yellow and blue sources were demonstrated at tens of watts
        average power" [A]. It confirms
      that in "the past few years, with further development, IPG have
        commercialized the high power
        green system based upon SHG [second-harmonic generation] in crystals
        pumped by seeded Yb
        fibre lasers and these highly reliable and efficient systems should
        rapidly replace large frame
        inefficient Argon ion lasers and other traditional solid state solutions"
      [A].
    Regarding sales of the visible fibre laser systems developed from the
      original research programme
      of the Imperial group, IPG confirms that "In the past few years sales
        of green systems has
        exceeded 100 units of various specification, with the power in this
        family of devices now exceeding
        100W at 530nm and associated revenue was in excess of 3 million US$.
        Sales of Raman based
        units exceed those of the 530nm system." [A]
    The marriage of MOPFA technology with frequency doubling techniques in
      simple configurations
      has led to the commercialization of a family of compact and efficient high
      power lasers with
      exceptional wavelength coverage. With the lasers fundamentally based upon
      developments in
      telecommunications and through the use of telecommunications specified
      components, this has led
      to greater reliability and simplification, such that the basic commercial
      laser product requires no
      maintenance and is characterised by a simple user interface that requires
      no laser optimization
      procedures. As a consequence, the systems are in demand in the
      applications market place and
      this is best exemplified by the medical laser market, where the
      reliability, compactness, no need for
      servicing and cost reduction of fibre based laser medical systems has had
      instant impact.
    Over the period 2006-2010, high power Thulium fibre lasers operating at
      1940nm were developed
      in collaboration with IPG Photonics for applications in surgery. The water
      peak absorption of tissue
      at 1940nm allows for faster ablation and tissue removal compared to
      procedures developed for the
      Holmium laser at 2100nm. A 120W laser system was developed utilizing
      single transverse mode
      pumping from a Yb:Er laser system - the Thulium Fiber Laser System [B].
      Collaborative clinical
      trials were instigated at the Chelyabinsk Medical Centre, Russia and at
      StarMedTech in Germany.
      StarMedTech, an international medical technology company specialising in
      surgical laser system
      technology, also includes a 120W 1.9&amp;#181;m Thulium laser in its product line &amp;#8212;
      the vela&amp;#174; XL laser [C].
      This laser is advertised for use in "urology, gynecology, ENT,
        pneumology, neurology and surgery"
      [C]. As with the IPG Photonics 1940nm lasers, due "to its high
        absorption in water, the optimized
        wavelength of 1.9&amp;#181;m is ideal for haemostatic cutting of soft and hard
        tissue" [C].
    Dr Popov and the Femtosecond Optics Group at Imperial College have
      collaborated closely with
      the Medical Laser Division of IPG in the development, trials and
      commercialization of several fibre
      laser platforms for various medical procedures, some of which are now
      routinely applied. This is
      confirmed in a letter by NTO-IRE Polus (part of the IPG Photonics
      Corporation): "The research and
        development in fiber lasers at Imperial College, followed by
        commercialization by IPG Photonics
        allowed us to develop integrated medical devices, conduct trials and
        qualify medical technologies
        for surgery, ENT, gynaecological, prostate treatments and vein therapy
        in Russia, Germany and
        USA" [D]. In Russia alone "over one thousand ENT operations were
        successfully performed on 330
        patients, 3.5 to 66 year old, in the Second Central Medical Clinic using
        Raman and Er fiber laser
        based surgical instruments. In Chelyabinsk at the Medical and Physics
        Center of the Chelyabinsk
        State Medical Academy 104 patients, age 34 to 68, with gynaecological
        problems were
        successfully treated using Tm fiber laser based devices" [D].
    Further confirmation of the medical impact of the fiber lasers comes from
      the University of Illinois at
      Chicago. The director of the Dental Emergency Medicine Responder Training
      (DEMRT) Office
      confirms "Dr. Popov and I have collaborated in the research and
        development (R&amp;amp;D) of fiber based
        lasers for medical and dental spectroscopy, diagnostics, non-surgical,
        and surgical applications
        since 2008. His applied and clinical laser device and applications
        research, for laser based
        diagnostics, dentistry, medicine, and surgery, have been critical for
        our clinical needs...We have
        collaborated with a number of medical centers and companies across the
        world, all of whom
        express continued interest in developing new medical and dental devices
        and procedures for
        global and international health needs...The lasers developed at Imperial
        College have been
        commercialized by IPG Photonics and applied in medical applications such
        as dentistry, oral
        surgery, ENT, gynecology, prostate treatment; aesthetics and have
        already passed medical trials
        and certification in Russia, Europe, USA and Asia." [E]
    The important role of Dr Popov and the Femtosecond Group in the
      commercialization of the fiber
      laser sources is nicely summarized in the following additional quotes: "Dr
        Popov's input has been
        an important and vital ingredient in the route to commercialization [of
      medical laser systems]" [A],
      and "The results of the research conducted by Dr Popov at Femtosecond
        Group at Imperial
        College in collaboration with IPG Photonics have clearly resulted in
        practical apparatus which was
        successfully applied to novel low-invasive medical treatments" [D].

    The development of a family of compact and efficient, high-power,
      fibre-based lasers that are
      designed to operate over broad wavelength ranges has led to new product
      lines that have had
      recognizable economic impact on the commercial laser market place. The
      basic research on these
      unique lasers was initially undertaken by Imperial College London and
      their development, power
      scaling and application were carried out in collaboration with IPG
      Photonics Corporation, the
      world's leading manufacturer of high power fibre lasers and amplifiers.
      Devices operating in
      several wavelength ranges have been particularly commercially successful
      in the scientific laser
      market and have also been applied in various clinical trials and
      treatments, demonstrating impact
      in the heath sector. Sales of the high-power, fibre-based lasers with IPG
      Photonics have exceeded
      $3M in the past few years.

    P3 - The commercialisation of fibre laser sources with medical
      applications
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Physics</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    Over the past decade probably the most spectrally versatile laser based
      source has been the so
      called "white light laser" or supercontinuum source. The ability to cover
      the complete window of
      transmission of silica based fibre from about 330nm to 2300nm has enabled
      applications as
      diverse as remote sensing and medical imaging. High average power
      supercontinuum operation is
      possible with up to 100mW/nm spectral power density achievable [e.g. 1],
      albeit using an industrial
      scaled pump laser. Most typical commercial supercontinuum units deliver
      maximum spectral power
      densities in the region of 10mW/nm and at Imperial College we have
      developed such modestly
      powered continuously pumped systems for medical imaging applications, such
      as optical
      coherence tomography (e.g. Bizheva et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 10,
      1073, 2006). For many
      real world applications spectral diversity coupled with high average power
      operation in specific
      spectral windows is an essential requirement and spectral selection or
      filtering from a
      supercontinuum provides inadequate average power levels. The realization
      of more applicable
      fibre based sources is the subject of this impact case study.
    A key contributing component to the spectrally diverse, high power fibre
      laser sources described
      here was the introduction of the concept of the master oscillator power
      fibre amplifier (MOPFA) that
      was developed by the Imperial College group in collaboration with IPG
      Photonics [2]. The
      advantage of the MOPFA technique is that it utilizes an integrated low
      power seed and this seed
      can be in any format continuous wave (cw), nanosecond or picosecond. It
      can be a laser diode or
      fibre laser that is sequentially amplified in fibre to average saturation
      powers well in excess of 1kW.
      Single frequency operation is possible through manipulation of the
      amplifier geometry, while
      nonlinear effects such as spectral broadening can be negated through use
      of large mode area
      amplifying fibre.
    Our initial MOPFA based studies primarily related to Yb and Yb:Er rare
      earth doped schemes,
      operating with tuneable bandwidths of about 40nm in the spectral region
      around 1060nm and
      1550nm respectively. We originally investigated spectral diversity through
      the use of single pass
      second harmonic generation (SHG) in periodically poled lithium niobate
      (PPLN) in 1998 [3],
      however, with average powers of several watts in the green,
      photo-darkening in the PPLN was a
      severe limiting problem. Photo-darkening with high power operation at
      530nm was overcome in
      2004 by the Imperial College group through the use of MgO doped
      stoichiometric periodically poled
      lithium tantalite [4]. Since then, and under the auspices of a Royal
      Society Industrial Fellowship
      carried out in association with IPG Photonics, Dr S. Popov of the Imperial
      College group has
      collaborated with the industrial partner in further developing high
      average power green sources
      based upon doubling in novel cavities incorporating poled crystals pumped
      by cw Yb MOPFA
      schemes.
    In the visible, wavelength versatility was also demonstrated by the
      Imperial group in the first
      reported frequency doubling of a bismuth silica fibre laser giving up to
      6.5W average power in the
      yellow at 589nm (a wavelength of interest for artificial guide star
      generation and also of relevance
      for acne and vein treatments) single pass in PPLN [5]. Wavelength
      diversity was also achieved at
      the watt level by a second cascaded second harmonic generation of both the
      Yb and Yb:Er laser
      systems, allowing operation in the blue and ultra violet. Sum frequency
      wavelength mixing of the
      Yb and Er systems also permitted somewhat limited wavelength tunability
      around 635nm, again at
      watts average power levels.
    The greatest wavelength diversity was achieved through development of the
      fibre Raman MOPFA
      undertaken at Imperial College in collaboration with personnel from IPG
      Photonics. The use of
      novel short length, high power cascaded fibre Raman laser structures
      allowed complete
      wavelength coverage from 1000nm to 2000nm. Our research programme,
      undertaken to minimize
      the effects of in-fibre nonlinearity, allowed high power operation with
      narrow linewidths and
      polarization preserving geometries. This allowed highly efficient second
      harmonic generation of the
      tunable Raman lasers from 500nm to 1000nm and with operational powers in
      the harmonic
      signals in excess of 3W [6], consequently permitting spectral coverage
      matching the
      supercontinuum source but with average power levels nearly three orders of
      magnitude higher.
    The personnel contributing to this research programme at Imperial College
      London were Dr S V
      Popov, Prof J R Taylor, and PG Research Students Mr. A.B. Rulkov, Mr. B.
      Cumberland and Mr
      S.A. Guskov. Dr Rulkov (PhD 2008) is employed by IPG Lasers GmbH. Mr
      Cumberland (PhD
      2009) took up employment with Coherent UK. Mr Guskov joined IPG Lasers
      GmbH as lead

    The first commercial impact of the research came when the Imperial-spin&#xD;
      out QuantaSol was formed in 2007 by Keith Barnham, Massimo Mazzer (a&#xD;
      visiting Professor at Imperial) and John Roberts (EPSRC National Centre&#xD;
      for III-V Technology). QuantaSol's aim was to exploit QW technology in&#xD;
      multi-junction concentrator cells. The company was funded by Imperial&#xD;
      Innovations and the Low Carbon Accelerator. It was located in&#xD;
      Kingston-upon-Thames and employed between 12-16 people. In May 2009 it was&#xD;
      announced that QuantaSol had received &amp;#163;1.35m of investment from a&#xD;
      syndicate of investors including the Low Carbon Accelerator, Imperial&#xD;
      Innovations, Numis Securities Ltd and Netscientific Ltd [A]. The first&#xD;
      performance impact of the new company came in June 2009. For six months&#xD;
      the company broke and held a 21-year-old world record for a single&#xD;
      junction concentrator cell with 28.3% efficiency at 534 times&#xD;
      concentration, verified by the Fraunhofer ISE [B, C]. This "new&#xD;
        generation of 'nano-structured' millimetre-sized solar cells...could&#xD;
        convert the sun's energy to electricity more than twice as efficiently&#xD;
        as current technology, [and] can be tuned to the prevailing light&#xD;
        conditions of a particular place, to get the most out of the cells&#xD;
        wherever they are" [C]. Commenting on the world record Kevin Arthur,&#xD;
      QuantaSol's CEO, said "Our technology is the industry's best kept&#xD;
        secret. This is the first time that anyone has successfully combined&#xD;
        high efficiency with ease of manufacture, historically a bug-bear of the&#xD;
        solar cell industry" [C]. The potential commercial and environmental&#xD;
      impact of QuantaSol was recognised by the award of the Guardian CleanTech&#xD;
      Top 100 company status in both 2008 and 2009 [D, E].&#xD;
    In late 2010 QuantaSol first manufactured triple junction cells with&#xD;
      strain-balanced QWSCs in the middle sub-cell. A median efficiency of 39.7%&#xD;
      was achieved for 171 cells on a production wafer [F], comparable with the&#xD;
      performance of cells from the market leader Spectrolab [G]. It was clear&#xD;
      that the strain-balanced QWSC was responsible for this enhanced&#xD;
      performance as a control wafer without the quantum wells had a median&#xD;
      efficiency of only 36.3% [F].&#xD;
    In 2011 the QuantaSol triple-junction cells passed technical&#xD;
      qualification with Amonix, the leading US concentrator manufacturer, who&#xD;
      qualified them for "commercial deployment" [H] in their high&#xD;
      concentration systems. The only other concentrator cell manufacturer to&#xD;
      achieve this status by 2011 was Spectrolab. As a result QuantaSol received&#xD;
      a substantial order from Amonix of 1MW of concentrator cells (approx.&#xD;
      50,000 cells) [H]. Amonix report that "the QuantaSol design was better&#xD;
        matched to Amonix specifications than any other cell design we have&#xD;
        evaluated to date" [H].&#xD;
    A further significant performance impact of the QuantaSol cells was&#xD;
      reported by Amonix in December 2011 [I]. They field tested cells from six&#xD;
      suppliers including QuantaSol. The depth of the quantum wells in the&#xD;
      QuantaSol cells had been optimised for the Amonix target solar spectrum.&#xD;
      Fig. 12 in their paper [I] presents the ratio of currents in top and&#xD;
      middle cell for field tests in six locations in the south-west of the US.&#xD;
      These ratios were closer to unity in the QuantaSol case (vendor 3) than in&#xD;
      the case of the other five vendors. The unity ratio corresponds to the&#xD;
      highest efficiency performance, confirming the advantage of the QWSC to&#xD;
      optimise for maximum energy harvest in different locations.&#xD;
    QuantaSol was sold to JDSU, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer, in&#xD;
      July 2011. The 2012 Annual Report from JDSU reported "the acquisition&#xD;
        of critical product design, patented intellectual property and other&#xD;
        assets from QuantaSol, for a cash purchase price consideration of&#xD;
        approximately $3.7 million" [J]. Alan Lowe, President of JDSU's CCOP&#xD;
      unit, said of the purchase: "Incorporating key QuantaSol technology&#xD;
        will allow us to further differentiate our products and expand our&#xD;
        position in the CPV solar market as popularity for CPV continues to grow"&#xD;
      [K]. All IP generated by Imperial and QuantaSol research passed to the&#xD;
      ownership of JDSU. The most important of these for the 40% triple junction&#xD;
      cell was licensed by Imperial Innovations exclusively to QuantaSol [P1].&#xD;
      Under the terms of the sale this patent will now be licensed to JDSU with&#xD;
      Imperial Innovations to accrue royalties from it.&#xD;
    The next performance milestone of the strain-balanced QWSC came at the 4th&#xD;
      International Concentrator Photovoltaic (CPV) Workshop in China in&#xD;
      September 2012. Jan-Gustav Werthen of JDSU announced that the company&#xD;
      manufacture cells on larger than standard wafers with median efficiency&#xD;
      41.5% [L]. These cells have significantly higher efficiency performance&#xD;
      than Spectrolab cells, the market leader in CPV and a Boeing subsidiary.&#xD;
      The data sheet on the Spectrolab web-site claim that their CPV cells on&#xD;
      standard sized wafers have a "typical efficiency" of 40% [G].&#xD;
    A significant commercial impact of the strain-balanced QWSC is revealed&#xD;
      by the current JDSU data sheet [M]. This shows results from 1160 cells&#xD;
      nearly all of which had cell efficiency above 40%. The spread in&#xD;
      efficiency is remarkably small considering that this was the first report&#xD;
      of quantum well cells grown on wafers with more than double the area of&#xD;
      the standard wafer. The uniform performance is important as many cells are&#xD;
      connected in series in concentrator systems. The larger wafer size will&#xD;
      also impact by reducing cell costs.&#xD;
    As reported in Section 3, research by the QPV group in collaboration with&#xD;
      Sheffield in the period 2007 - 2011 underpinned another advantage for&#xD;
      QuantaSol [Patent US 20110180129 A1]. Quantum wells in the quaternary&#xD;
      material GaInAsP lattice matched to the GaInP of the top cell were&#xD;
      developed. This QW system turned out to have unexpectedly high radiative&#xD;
      efficiencies. The performance impact of this further Imperial research was&#xD;
      demonstrated in a JDSU presentation in 2013 where they announced a further&#xD;
      1% absolute efficiency increase in production cells by incorporating&#xD;
      quaternary QWs in the top sub-cell [N]. The wafer average of 42.5% makes&#xD;
      JDSU the manufacturer of the world's highest efficiency production cells.&#xD;
      At the same meeting Solar Junction, who hold the record for research cell&#xD;
      efficiency, reported a median efficiency of 41.9% for their production&#xD;
      cells [O]. Additionally QWs in both the top and middle cell make it&#xD;
      possible to independently optimise both top and middle cell absorption&#xD;
      edges, which cannot be done with conventional cells. Hence it will be&#xD;
      possible to maximise energy harvest as spectral conditions and cell&#xD;
      temperature vary during the day and over the year. This will extend the&#xD;
      range of beneficiaries of CPV technology outside the southwest US,&#xD;
      potentially world-wide and also enable novel low carbon applications of&#xD;
      CPV such as in building integration and powering electric cars [F].&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    The quantum well solar cell (QWSC) was invented, developed and patented&#xD;
      by the Quantum Photovoltaics (QPV) research group at Imperial. QuantaSol&#xD;
      was spun out of Imperial college in 2007 and was awarded Guardian&#xD;
      CleanTech Top 100 awards in 2008 and 2009. In May 2009 it received &amp;#163;1.35m&#xD;
      of funding from a syndicate of investors. In 2011 QuantaSol was bought by&#xD;
      JDSU, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer, for US $3.7million. The&#xD;
      quantum well (QW) technology developed by the QPV group enabled QuantaSol,&#xD;
      and subsequently JDSU, to manufacture QWSCs with efficiencies above those&#xD;
      of the then market leaders, Spectrolab and Solar Junction. Uniquely, QWs&#xD;
      will allow JDSU to optimise cells for maximum energy harvest in different&#xD;
      solar spectra. This will increase world-wide the beneficiaries of&#xD;
      concentrator technology and enable other low-carbon applications in&#xD;
      building integration and electric transport. The Imperial research has&#xD;
      thus had (i) economic impact through the adoption of improved technology&#xD;
      and (ii) environmental impact through the take up of QWSCs by JDSU.&#xD;

    The QWSC was invented by Keith Barnham and Geoff Duggan in 1989 (1990, J.&#xD;
      Appl. Phys, 67, 3490). Quantum wells (QWs) enhance efficiency by&#xD;
      making it possible to optimise the wavelength at which the cells absorb&#xD;
      sunlight. The basic idea was patented [US patent No. 5,496,415] and a&#xD;
      number of versions of the cell were developed in over 2 decades of&#xD;
      research supported by EPSRC [e.g. G1, G2], the EU and the Greenpeace&#xD;
      Trust.&#xD;
    In 1991 the Quantum Photovoltaic (QPV) group at Imperial first&#xD;
      demonstrated that incorporating QWs into a cell enhances the efficiency&#xD;
      compared to a control cell without wells (1991, Appl. Phys. Lett., 59,&#xD;
      135). From 1990 to 2009 the underpinning device physics of QW solar cells&#xD;
      was researched and a simulation programme SOL developed to model QWSC&#xD;
      performance [1]. This work was reviewed in an invited chapter in a&#xD;
      definitive textbook on the uses of nanotechnology in photovoltaics&#xD;
      (Nanotechnology for Photovoltaics, ed. Loucas Tsakalakos, CRC Press,&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
    A key research insight for the commercialisation of this technology came&#xD;
      in 1999 when the strain-balanced QWSC was invented at Imperial and grown&#xD;
      successfully by collaborators at the EPSRC National Centre for III-V&#xD;
      Technology at the University of Sheffield [2]. This version of the cell is&#xD;
      protected by a U.S. patent which is exclusively licensed by Imperial&#xD;
      Innovations to JDSU [P1]. The significance of this research is that the&#xD;
      band-gap energy of GaAs is higher than optimal. Competitors lower the&#xD;
      band-gap by growing an alloy InGaAs which has a bigger atomic separation&#xD;
      than GaAs. This introduces dislocations which reduce device performance.&#xD;
      The strain-balanced QWSC approach introduces the InGaAs alloy as few nm&#xD;
      wide QWs separated by wider barriers formed from the alloy GaAsP which has&#xD;
      a narrower atomic spacing. The approach which balances the stress at the&#xD;
      well-barrier interfaces was worked out at Imperial and formed the basis of&#xD;
      the patent [3, P1].&#xD;
    The complete absence of dislocations in a strain-balanced QWSC means that&#xD;
      the recombination of carriers is reduced. The unavoidable radiative&#xD;
      recombination back into photons dominates. In a QW cell even this loss can&#xD;
      be overcome by reflecting these photons back into the cell. The QPV group&#xD;
      demonstrated the advantages of photon-recycling in a solar cell for the&#xD;
      first time [4].&#xD;
    A second key research insight for the commercialisation and the breadth&#xD;
      of potential beneficiaries was the discovery of a second radiatively&#xD;
      efficient QW system suitable for the GaInP top sub-cell of the&#xD;
      triple-junction. Experiments at Imperial showed that QWs made from a&#xD;
      quaternary alloy GaInAsP in GaInP barriers had much better quality than&#xD;
      other options. This was an unexpected research insight as the quaternary&#xD;
      alloy has very poor crystal quality in bulk quantities. However, the QPV&#xD;
      group demonstrated that nm wide QWs on this alloy had high radiative&#xD;
      efficiency. On the basis of the experimental results from Imperial, John&#xD;
      Roberts the crystal grower at Sheffield applied for a patent (US&#xD;
      20110180129 A1).&#xD;
    The breadth of the beneficiaries of this research has been greatly&#xD;
      extended by this new QW system. QWs in the top and middle sub-cells make&#xD;
      it possible to optimise the wavelengths at which both the top and middle&#xD;
      cells absorb sunlight. Hence dual-QW cells have the unique advantage of&#xD;
      being able to tune the cell for different spectra to be found in different&#xD;
      locations and in other low-carbon applications. Another unique advantage&#xD;
      of the top sub-cell wells is that the radiative recombination coupled from&#xD;
      the top to middle sub-cells cell will reduce sensitivity of the&#xD;
      multi-junction cell to spectral and temperature variation, greatly&#xD;
      extending the breadth of beneficiaries of this technology [5].&#xD;

    Agilium software for Business Process Management
    The development of CRISTAL was conducted in close consultation with user
      communities &amp;#8212; initially
      physicists and engineers at CERN [see source S1] and latterly in commerce
      for eBusiness
      users. This enabled its rapid adoption by industry and in 2003 a version
      of CRISTAL was
      developed and sold as support for applications of business process
      management (BPM) by the
      M1i company in France. It can handle the complexity of data-intensive
      systems and provide the
      flexibility to adapt to the changing scenarios required by any process in
      which workflow and data
      traceability is crucial.
    It has been sold by M1i under the product name Agilium
      (2003 &amp;#8212; 2013) into the retail, finance and manufacturing
      sectors of European industry, for use in the area of BPM.
      UWE advised on the adaptation of the CRISTAL kernel to
      enable M1i to develop BPM support. Agilium used the kernel for workflow
      and process traceability,
      and also for the integration and co-operation of multiple business
      processes in business-to-business
      (B2B) applications. The M1i product enables commercial processes to be
      harmonised
      using a CRISTAL database, tracks their workflows and integrates multiple
      potentially
      heterogeneous processes, such as order processing, sales management and
      business logistics.
    
	
	
    Benefits of Agilium realised in a variety of businesses
    CRISTAL-Agilium has found application in, for example, the systems used
      by Nexcis for
      photovoltaic cell production, by the Ville de Lyon (France) for managing
      operational procedures,
      and by the STTS specialist aerospace painting/sealing company for managing
      its internal business
      process controls. In particular Agilium enables these customers to trace
      their data across
      applications and to adapt to system evolution with little or no disruption
      to their live systems.
    CRISTAL-Agilium also integrates the management of data coming from
      different sources and
      unites Business Process Management with Business Activity Management (BAM)
      through the
      capture and management of their designs in CRISTAL. This has been applied
      at the Bayer Group,
      where CRISTAL-Agilium has enabled customers to conduct and handle B2B
      transactions and to
      facilitate the management of targeted domains (e.g. logistics, retail and
      government domains).
      Other CRISTAL-Agilium clients of M1i include Dynastar, GDP Vendome, the
      ski resort of Tignes,
      Photowatt Technologies, SoTRADEL and Midor. The software is used to manage
      the processes of
      and between these commercial companies enabling M1i to gain a unique
      position in the BPM
      market (recognised by the Gartner Group, 2009 [S2] and IT advisors CXP
      [S3]). Commercial
      income generated by CRISTAL-Agilium licence sales by M1i in the period
      2008-2013 top &amp;#8364;1.0M.
      To quote the CEO of M1i: "the quality of the (CRISTAL) research
        transfer gives us key benefits to
        differentiate our solutions on the market" and to "justify our
        position as an innovative SME
        company for our customers and partners" [S4].
    M1i and Alpha-3i companies commercialise further applications of
        CRISTAL
    In 2011 UWE and M1i, together with the Alpha-3i company (France), were
      awarded &amp;#8364;1.5M under
      the FP7 Marie Curie Industry-Academic Partnership Pathways (IAPP)
      programme to develop
      CRISTAL for the next generation of business applications. This CRISTAL-ISE
      partnership has
      already enhanced CRISTAL with distribution and semantic features. Since
      its inception both
      companies have benefitted from CRISTAL's design flexibility and ability to
      evolve dynamically in
      order to upgrade their commercial offerings for a growing customer base
      more rapidly that was
      previously possible.
    Application and commercialisation beyond BPM &amp;#8212; Technoledge start-up
    CRISTAL has been recently further exploited by the
      Technoledge start-up company. Starting in early 2012,
      Technoledge has been working closely with UWE to adapt
      CRISTAL to domains outside of BPM [S5]. Amongst other
      areas, application of CRISTAL at CEA (France) has
      demonstrated, for the first time, full traceability from raw
      materials to final product facilitated by the use of CRISTAL in
      manufacturing execution systems.
      This has led to the following outcomes:
    
      Technoledge use CRISTAL to provide the support for the development of
        production lines at
        CEA to manufacture next-generation sustainable fuel cells for future
        electric vehicles.
      In collaboration with the COGEP consortium (one of the five largest
        accountancy consortia
        across France), Technoledge has exploited CRISTAL to integrate several
        previously
        outsourced software packages for a major French accountancy firm, taking
        advantage of
        CRISTAL's ability to manage several contrasting models in the same
        workspace.
      In the summer of 2013 the Advanced Accelerator Applications group
        adopted CRISTAL as the
        basis of its production management system for the production of
        radiopharmaceuticals for
        distribution to hospitals in the Rhone-Alpes region of France.
    
    Since 2008, CCCS has also collaborated with the neuGRID and N4U (`neuGRID
      for Users')
      projects to provide a system for clinicians investigating biomarkers for
      Alzheimer's disease [S6].
      CRISTAL has been used to track the analysis of algorithms and large data
      sets to help identify
      patients who may be susceptible to mild cognitive impairment that could
      lead to dementia. Early
      identification of such conditions is enabling doctors in medical centres
      across Europe to diagnose
      Alzheimer's Disease and thereby to prescribe suitable drug therapies to
      slow its onset.
    The provenance of data and processes is central to these business
      operations. CRISTAL has
      enabled the systematic management of data and processes in a maintainable,
      flexible and
      evolvable, and thus profitable, manner.
	  
	  
	  
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The volume and diversity of data that companies need to handle are
      increasing exponentially. In
      order to compete effectively and ensure companies' commercial
      sustainability, it is becoming
      crucial to achieve robust traceability in both their data and the evolving
      designs of their systems.
      The CRISTAL software addresses this. It was originally developed at CERN,
      with substantial
      contributions from UWE Bristol, for one of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
      experiments, and has
      been transferred into the commercial world. Companies have been able to
      demonstrate increased
      agility, generate additional revenue, and improve the efficiency and
      cost-effectiveness with which
      they develop and implement systems in various areas, including business
      process management
      (BPM), healthcare and accounting applications. CRISTAL's ability to manage
      data and their
      provenance at the terabyte scale, with full traceability over extended
      timescales, based on its
      description-driven approach, has provided the adaptability required to
      future proof dynamically
      evolving software for these businesses.
    This case study embodies a non-linear relationship between underpinning
      research, software
      development and deployment. It involves computer science research at UWE
      in conjunction with
      its applied development for the world's largest particle physics
      laboratory and onward deployment
      commercially into private sector industry.

    Facilitating System Evolution during Design and Implementation: CRISTAL
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Computer Science and Informatics</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    Organisations are increasingly operating within environments that present
      unforeseeable change.
      Systems must evolve dynamically in response to changes in technology and
      consequently there
      must be full traceability between the design and evolving system
      specifications.
    Underpinning research to address this challenge at UWE's Centre for
      Complex Cooperative
      Systems (CCCS) from 1997 onwards (see [1] and [2]) has been led by Richard
      McClatchey (UWE
      Professor 2000-present, Reader 1997-2000, Senior Lecturer 1991-1997),
      Jean-Marie Le Goff
      (UWE Visiting Professor from CERN 2003-2009) and Andrew Branson (UWE
      Research Associate
      2006-present). It has also involved key input from Nigel Baker (UWE Reader
      1999-2011, Senior
      Lecturer 1988-1999), Tony Solomonides (UWE Reader 1999-2010, Head of
      Department 1992-1999)
      and Wayne Harris (UWE Senior Lecturer 1990-2004).
    The research has identified the importance of developing software whose
      specifications evolve
      beyond the design phase, a process which may have no definite endpoint.
      CCCS has pioneered a
      development approach that allows systems to reconfigure themselves
      dynamically, enabling
      software to be versioned and rolled out into production to sit seamlessly
      alongside existing live
      systems without designer intervention.
    This approach has been applied, in collaboration with CERN (Switzerland)
      and CNRS (France), to
      the creation of a novel development environment called CRISTAL initially
      for CERN's CMS
      (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment [5], to address that experiment's
      software needs over
      extended design timelines. McClatchey is co-inventor of CRISTAL and
      Branson is the lead
      software architect. The production version of the software was developed
      by McClatchey &amp;amp;
      Branson with assistance from UWE PhD students and post-docs from
      2001-2003. In 2006,
      Branson joined UWE to continue the project. CRISTAL embodies a
      "description-driven" approach
      [2]: all logic and data structures are described by metadata, which can be
      modified and versioned
      online as the design of the system changes. McClatchey and UWE colleagues
      have shown that the
      creation of a flexible system can be facilitated by carefully modelling
      the metadata: the resulting
      software is reusable across applications and can handle complexity,
      version control and system
      evolution. CRISTAL was used to calibrate CMS and thus aided its discovery
      of the Higgs Boson
      (2012). The advantages of separating design, implementation and
      instantiation further vindicate
      the use of such "meta-models" (see [3] and [4]).
    The strength and validation of
      McClatchey and colleagues' research
      findings is demonstrated in the robust
      CRISTAL solutions realised at CERN
      and in industry. During the
      construction period of the CMS
      Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL)
      from 1999 to 2008, over 70,000
      individual lead tungstate crystals
      were characterised and their data
      and full provenance captured in
      CRISTAL. Each ECAL crystal
      generated between 3-5 Mbytes of
      information which was gathered in a
      crystal characterisation system,
      called ACCOS (see [5]). CRISTAL
      provided round-the-clock information
      logging and only needed to be
      upgraded seven times during eight
      years of continuous operation, only one being a major update (see
      http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/cristal-database).
      The CRISTAL research was released by UWE to
      industry and became the basis for the programme of external exploitation
      by M1i, France, in
      Business Process Management (BPM) solutions between 2003 to the present.
      CRISTAL has
      demonstrated its ability to be responsive to changing user requirements
      and to support on-the-fly
      system evolution over extended product lifecycles, as evidenced by its use
      and exploitation by M1i.
    
	
	
	CRISTAL has been targeted at scientific data provenance and workflow
      orchestration [6] in the
      neuGRID project (2008-2011) and its follow up neuGRIDforUsers project
      (N4U, 2011-2014).
      Clinical researchers across Europe have been using CRISTAL on the neuGRID
      infrastructure to
      support ongoing studies of Alzheimer's Disease biomarkers. It is also
      being used for tracking by
      hospitals in the FP7 EndoTOFPET-US project which is developing next
      generation PET scanners.
    Thus the underpinning research reaches beyond its academic discipline of
      computer science
      leading to impact in other `academic' fields such as physics and medicine.
      Its further impact
      beyond research and particularly in terms of commercial relevance is set
      out in Section 4.

    From research to impact&#xD;
    XstalBio Ltd was formed as a spin-out company in 2004 to license,&#xD;
      commercialise, and extend the&#xD;
      intellectual property associated with the protein and vaccine&#xD;
      stabilisation technology. XstalBio's&#xD;
      technology adds therapeutic value, accelerates the development, and&#xD;
      extends the life-cycles of&#xD;
      protein-based drugs as well as enabling new product opportunities. The&#xD;
      company targets the&#xD;
      $50bn currently spent per annum by the pharmaceutical industry on&#xD;
      biopharmaceutical product&#xD;
      development. XstalBio markets its expertise and technology to these pharma&#xD;
      companies with the&#xD;
      aim of enabling development of improved formulation and delivery methods&#xD;
      for new candidate&#xD;
      biologic drugs and vaccines.&#xD;
    In an internationally competitive market, XstalBio has succeeded in&#xD;
      selling contracts for access to&#xD;
      its Intellectual Property Portfolio for over 8 years and has continuously&#xD;
      developed the patented&#xD;
      technology to meet the new challenges facing the biopharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry. These contracts,&#xD;
      worth &amp;#163;2.2M over the period 2008-2012, are underpinned by option license&#xD;
      agreements taken out&#xD;
      on the WestCHEM owned patents. An early client was Boehringer Ingelheim&#xD;
      who subsequently&#xD;
      licensed the stabilisation technology from XstalBio, primarily for&#xD;
      delivery of biologics by inhalation.&#xD;
      As part of this license agreement the two companies co-developed and built&#xD;
      a dedicated GMP&#xD;
      compliant pilot plant for inhalation dry powders, which was commissioned&#xD;
      in Biberach, Germany in&#xD;
      2008 at cost of &amp;#8364;5M.&#xD;
    Development programmes have also been carried out with, or are on-going&#xD;
      with, other major&#xD;
      pharmaceutical companies including [text removed for publication] with&#xD;
      most contracts being with&#xD;
      biologic drug development groups from outside the UK. The specific details&#xD;
      of these are subject to&#xD;
      stringent commercial confidentiality agreements but in general the role of&#xD;
      XstalBio is to accelerate&#xD;
      development, enhance therapeutic value, or manage the life-cycle of the&#xD;
      biopharmaceutical by&#xD;
      providing innovative dry powder formulations which improve the overall&#xD;
      product profile.&#xD;
    Type of Impact&#xD;
      An important impact of the original research has been economic with the&#xD;
      launch and growth of a&#xD;
      sustainable UK based SME with global reach in the pharmaceutical industry.&#xD;
      In the period 2008-2012,&#xD;
      the company made international sales of its Intellectual Property of &amp;#163;2.2M&#xD;
      and employed 8&#xD;
      full-time research and development scientists at BSc and PhD level. The&#xD;
      company has also&#xD;
      supported and trained 3 PhD CASE studentships based at WestCHEM and the&#xD;
      London School of&#xD;
      Pharmacy.&#xD;
    Vaccines and medicines based on biomolecules will be major engines of&#xD;
      growth in the&#xD;
      pharmaceutical industry over the coming decades. The significant payments&#xD;
      by international&#xD;
      companies to XstalBio for access to its IP portfolio demonstrate that its&#xD;
      biologic formulation and&#xD;
      drug delivery technologies lie at the commercial cutting-edge and are&#xD;
      impacting on the direction&#xD;
      taken by top ten pharmaceutical companies in developing the next&#xD;
      generation of biologic&#xD;
      medicines.&#xD;
    Unmet product and process needs that XstalBio Technology is being used to&#xD;
      address include:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Delivery by inhalation with a dry powder inhaler requires sensitive&#xD;
        biologics to be processed&#xD;
        into particles in the size-range of 3-5 microns with no loss of tertiary&#xD;
        structure or bioactivity.&#xD;
        Techniques such as milling cannot be used and spray-drying produces&#xD;
        extremely moisture-sensitive&#xD;
        powders which require expensive protective packaging. The impact of&#xD;
        XstalBio's&#xD;
        PCMC technology in this field was recognised by Boehringer Ingelheim and&#xD;
        resulted in a&#xD;
        licensing agreement and significant investment in a GMP compliant&#xD;
        manufacturing facility&#xD;
        (estimated &amp;#8364;5M),&#xD;
      Shipping and storage of biomolecules without the need for continuous&#xD;
        refrigeration is a major&#xD;
        goal for organisations and companies that intend to supply diagnostics,&#xD;
        biological medicines&#xD;
        and vaccines in challenging environments such as remote regions in the&#xD;
        developing world.&#xD;
        XstalBio PCMC dry powders remain stable at high temperatures and in&#xD;
        humid conditions and&#xD;
        therefore offer considerable cost savings to its partners. Boehringer&#xD;
        Ingelheim has noted these&#xD;
        more efficient and cost effective manufacturing opportunities compared&#xD;
        with conventional&#xD;
        methods:&#xD;
    &#xD;
    "Particularly with regard to cost-effectiveness, precipitation methods&#xD;
        are attractive. An&#xD;
        interesting method is the protein-coated microcrystals (PCMC) technology&#xD;
        that stabilises&#xD;
        biomolecules on crystalline surfaces by co-precipitation during rapid&#xD;
        solvent exchange"&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Administration of therapeutic proteins at very high concentration by&#xD;
        subcutaneous delivery&#xD;
        would provide an alternative to lengthy infusions, reducing resource use&#xD;
        (time in clinic) and&#xD;
        improving quality of life for patients with chronic conditions. As was&#xD;
        demonstrated with a Pfizer&#xD;
        candidate human monoclonal antibody, the patented stabilising additives&#xD;
        prevent aggregation&#xD;
        and conserve bioactivity. Because the dry mAb powders can also be&#xD;
        rapidly reconstituted to&#xD;
        very high protein concentration (&amp;gt;200mg/ml) they are providing&#xD;
        industry with a radical&#xD;
        alternative to concentrating by TFF which becomes very difficult at high&#xD;
        viscosities.&#xD;

        modification is desirable. Use of a calcium phosphate shell allows&#xD;
        release of proteins from&#xD;
        PCMCs to be tuned from hours to days.&#xD;

    The collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim illustrates how the XstalBio&#xD;
      technology has had an&#xD;
      impact on a client's R&amp;amp;D strategy and investment. Boehringer Ingelheim&#xD;
      has stated publicly that&#xD;
      "Boehringer Ingelheim believes that the collaboration with XstalBio&#xD;
        will provide improved methods&#xD;
        for the formulation and delivery of biomolecules. The technology&#xD;
        provides a highly differentiated&#xD;
        method for preparing biomolecules as stable, solid formulations, with&#xD;
        the particles capable of being&#xD;
        engineered for delivery in a range of formulations via various routes of&#xD;
        administration. Both&#xD;
        partners will jointly develop and scale-up the PCMC technology for GMP&#xD;
        manufacturing at Pilot&#xD;
        scale."&#xD;
    The publication of the 6 filed and licensed patent families impacts on&#xD;
      the overall knowledge base&#xD;
      and direction of the pharmaceutical industry. This is evidenced by the&#xD;
      presence of 11 patent filings&#xD;
      from other companies, including BASF, Novo Nordisk, Boheringher Ingelheim,&#xD;
      Lek, Taisho&#xD;

    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    A novel self-assembly process, developed at WestCHEM was shown to provide&#xD;
      a step-change for&#xD;
      stabilising proteins as dry powders. The spin-out company, XstalBio, was&#xD;
      created in 2004 and&#xD;
      licensed the patented technology with the aim of developing it for&#xD;
      delivery and formulation of&#xD;
      therapeutic biomolecules and vaccines. Over the period 2008-2012, eight&#xD;
      leading international&#xD;
      pharmaceutical and animal health companies paid XstalBio over &amp;#163;2.2M for&#xD;
      access to its IP portfolio&#xD;
      and to undertake evaluation studies with candidate biomedicines and&#xD;
      vaccines. XstalBio employed&#xD;
      8 highly skilled research scientists over this period and 4 further patent&#xD;
      families were generated.&#xD;
      Boehringer Ingelheim licensed the technology for application to its&#xD;
      therapeutic biomolecules and in&#xD;
      collaboration with XstalBio built a dedicated &amp;#8364;5M pilot plant for&#xD;
      manufacture of inhalable dry&#xD;
      powders.&#xD;

    Context&#xD;
      Medicines based on biomolecules, including vaccines, are currently the&#xD;
      major engines of growth in&#xD;
      the pharmaceutical industry, with sales predicted to increase from ~$130bn&#xD;
      in 2012 to ~$280bn in&#xD;
      2022. The in vivo activity of biomolecules such as enzymes,&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines&#xD;
      is determined by the tertiary structure, i.e., the&#xD;
      three-dimensional conformation. This means that&#xD;
      biologic drugs are much less stable and therefore harder to formulate and&#xD;
      administer than&#xD;
      traditional small molecule drugs.&#xD;
    Research by the research groups of BD Moore (Senior Lecturer and Reader,&#xD;
      WestCHEM), PJ&#xD;
      Halling (Professor, WestCHEM) and MC Parker (Lecturer, WestCHEM) aimed to&#xD;
      facilitate the&#xD;
      transfer of active enzymes from aqueous to organic media to harness their&#xD;
      catalytic power in&#xD;
      organic synthesis. A key observation was that dehydration processes other&#xD;
      than lyophilisation&#xD;
      resulted in much better retention of enzyme catalytic activity and&#xD;
      excellent preservation of protein&#xD;
      tertiary structure in the dry state (1). The wider importance of this&#xD;
      finding was recognised and the&#xD;
      innovative stabilisation technology was translated into commercial&#xD;
      formulation of therapeutic&#xD;
      biomolecules and vaccines.&#xD;
    Key Findings&#xD;
      The pathway of transferring an enzyme from aqueous solution into&#xD;
      non-aqueous media is found to&#xD;
      be critical in maintaining catalytic activity and surprisingly,&#xD;
      conventional protein drying methods&#xD;
      such as lyophilisation give very poor results. Moore and Parker discovered&#xD;
      and patented ("Rapid&#xD;
      Dehydration of Proteins", WO0069887) a much more successful&#xD;
      process based on co-precipitation&#xD;
      of enzymes with an inorganic salt by addition of an aqueous mixture to an&#xD;
      excess of water-miscible&#xD;
      solvent (2). This method was designed to rapidly dehydrate the enzyme, as&#xD;
      the water dissolved&#xD;
      into the solvent, but the additional bonus was that it also resulted in&#xD;
      spontaneous formation of&#xD;
      microcrystals of the salt coated with protein. Self-assembly of these&#xD;
      protein-coated microcrystals&#xD;
      (PCMCs) was found to be applicable to all enzyme classes tested and the&#xD;
      process coupled with&#xD;
      control of protonation state (3) are recognised as benchmark methods for&#xD;
      preparing biocatalysts for&#xD;
      use in non-aqueous media. The high catalytic activity of enzymes on dry&#xD;
      PCMC particles was&#xD;
      postulated to be because an unusually high proportion of protein molecules&#xD;
      retained a native&#xD;
      tertiary conformation in the dry state. This was subsequently proven to be&#xD;
      the case by solid-state&#xD;
      circular dichroism spectroscopy and active site-titrations in dry solvent.&#xD;
    The excellent retention of protein native structure in PCMCs was&#xD;
      recognised to have applications&#xD;
      beyond biocatalysis and applied research at WestCHEM explored their&#xD;
      potential use as a platform&#xD;
      for delivery of therapeutic biomolecules by inhalation (4). This research&#xD;
      identified a novel method&#xD;
      for forming free-flowing dry powders by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide&#xD;
      extraction of suspensions&#xD;
      of PCMC in solvent. The formulations and process were patented&#xD;
      ("Pharmaceutical Composition",&#xD;
      WO2004062560) in conjunction with an alternate continuous flow&#xD;
      process for precipitating PCMC&#xD;
      particles ("Process for Preparing Microcrystals",&#xD;
	  WO2006010921). A range of physiologically&#xD;
      acceptable water-soluble crystals, including amino-acids and sugars, were&#xD;
      investigated with the&#xD;
      aim of preparing PCMC particles in the size-range 3-5 &amp;#181;m suitable for&#xD;
      delivery to the lung. Dry&#xD;
      powders of model proteins with promising aerodynamic properties were&#xD;
      identified and found to be&#xD;
      unusually stable to high temperature and humidity meaning they could be&#xD;
      stored without requiring&#xD;
      refrigeration or an inert atmosphere. These properties are highly&#xD;
      desirable for formulation and&#xD;
      delivery of biologic drugs and vaccines (5).&#xD;
    The spin-out of XstalBio in 2004 provided access to much more&#xD;
      aggregation-sensitive proteins&#xD;
      such as humanised monoclonal antibodies supplied by commercial partners,&#xD;
      and stimulated further&#xD;
      improvements to the technology. In research directed by Moore,&#xD;
      zwitterionic additives were&#xD;
      identified which disrupted aggregation of precipitated protein on exposure&#xD;
      to polar solvents and&#xD;
      enabled them to be incorporated onto the outer surface of the particles in&#xD;
      a native quaternary state&#xD;
      (6). These additives were patented ("Precipitation Stabilising&#xD;
      Compositions", WO2008132439) and&#xD;
      the technology has been successfully applied to the formulation of over&#xD;
      ten therapeutic monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies in development by pharmaceutical companies.&#xD;
    It was also shown that a double decomposition process could be carried&#xD;
      out in a polar organic&#xD;
      solvent between (i) phosphate salts that have been co-immobilised with&#xD;
      biomolecules on the&#xD;
      crystal surface and (ii) calcium chloride dissolved in the solvent. The&#xD;
      resultant outer shell of&#xD;
      sparingly aqueous-soluble calcium phosphate can be used to tune the rate&#xD;
      at which biomolecules&#xD;
      are released back into aqueous solution. Patented in 2008 ("Slow Release&#xD;
      Compositions",&#xD;
      WO2009077732) these findings have led to the development of vaccines in&#xD;
      which both antigens&#xD;
      and toll-like receptor agonists are co-immobilised on slow-release&#xD;
      particles, resulting in enhanced&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immune responses. These are being exploited in&#xD;
      temperature stable vaccines&#xD;
      for treatment of helminths in livestock and in vivo trials are&#xD;
      on-going in collaboration with the&#xD;
      Moredun Research Institute. All of the patents filed have been licensed to&#xD;

    WestCHEM develops software to support high-throughput systems
      At the same time that the precursor to PolySNAP, the SNAP-1D software
      package, was being
      developed at WestCHEM to facilitate an integrated approach to full x-ray
      powder-diffraction pattern
      analysis, the pharmaceutical industry was developing automated
      crystallisation systems using
      robotics, and was beginning to generate large volumes of one-dimensional
      diffraction patterns.
      However, there was no software available to process, classify, and
      visualise such data. PolySNAP
      was written under contract from Pfizer specifically to address this
      problem. It was the first software
      to do this and used novel statistics and visualisation methods. Data
      visualisation is a vital
      component of handling large amounts of data. With PolySNAP, time
      expenditure was reduced from
      days to seconds for &amp;gt;100 data sets. It is an almost impossible task to
      classify large data sets
      without these techniques and so any investment in the new robotic hardware
      would have been
      pointless. The software was described by one Pfizer employee as "like
      having a new spectroscopic
      method made available". A confidential list of PolySNAP users up to 2010
      is available, which
      contains 72 users with commercial licences (Source 2). The software was
      the property of Glasgow
      University until 2010 when Professor Gilmore retired, at which time it was
      sold to Bruker.
    PolySNAP supplied worldwide with Bruker diffractometers
      Bruker purchased the rights to the program from Pfizer in 2002-2003 for ca.
      &amp;#163;125k (the same as
      the original cost to Pfizer) and started to market PolySNAP commercially
      under licence from
      Glasgow University (Source 1). Until 2010, license fees to the University
      totalled &amp;#163;84,164 (from
      2008 &amp;#163;37,894) (Source 3). Bruker continued to develop this software and
      Gilmore set up a limited
      company partly for this purpose (Allander Science Ltd.) and continues to
      act as a consultant to
      Bruker. Dr Dong was employed full-time by Bruker during the assessment
      period. The
      development of PolySNAP also led to a free computer program called dSNAP
      that uses the same
      ideas to classify and visualise the results of searches on the Cambridge
      Structural Database (see
      below).
    New versions of the software were released: PolySNAP-2, PolySNAP-M, and
      the latest PolySNAP-3.
      PolySNAP-3 is unique in that it allows data from multiple sources,
      techniques or data collection
      strategies to be incorporated into the analysis. For example, data from
      powder diffraction can be
      combined with differential scanning calorimetry and Raman data to give a
      combined analysis and
      more accurate classifications of samples [5, 6]. This method is proving so
      important that Bruker are
      currently extending it to include x-ray fluorescence data in the new
      releases of PolySNAP. It saves
      money because it releases the time of highly paid scientific staff and it
      is also objective, avoiding
      the risk that exists with this sort of data that interpretation can become
      subjective.
    The relationship between Bruker and the University continued until 2010
      when Prof Gilmore
      retired. At that point, Bruker paid the equivalent of two years' license
      fees (&amp;#8364;30k) to purchase the
      software outright. PolySNAP continues to be a part of the company's
      development plan (Source 4).
      Current list price when PolySNAP is purchased separately is &amp;#8364;2,700, and
      approximately 120 have
      been sold since 2004, while Bruker also offers another version, m-SNAP, at
      a list price of &amp;#8364;5,000.
      PolySNAP continues to be sold in combination with all Bruker x-ray powder
      diffractometers.
    PolySNAP utilised across industry and education
      Although the impact beyond the sale of the software is very difficult to
      quantify, the beneficiaries of
      this software are many:
    
      The pharmaceutical industry: Most large pharmaceutical companies use
        PolySNAP: Novartis,
        AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Roche, Syngenta, Sanofi Aventis, and many smaller
        companies. It
        dramatically reduces both the timescale and the reliability of sample
        screening allowing even
        very large datasets (&amp;gt;100,000 samples) to be pre-screened in minutes
        to find the subset of
        patterns most relevant to a given target. Prior to PolySNAP, such
        searches would have used
        reduced patterns in which the powder data are presented as a small set
        of intensities and
        positions for the top 5-10 peaks. PolySNAP was the first program to use
        the full measured data
        in all its analysis steps. High-throughput data are of poor quality and
        using traditional reduced
        patterns is ineffective at best and often worthless.
      Mining industry: e.g., companies such as Anglo Platinum and Mintek in
        southern Africa, where
        PolySNAP software is used to assess the quality of ore samples prior to
        processing into pure
        metals, and to group huge quantities of materials of different origin.
        The software allows the
        companies to carry out rapid comprehensive assessments of ore
        variability in terms of bulk
        mineralogical composition and facilitating decision-making.
      Materials Science: identifying new materials, studying phase changes
        with temperature and
        pressure, simple quantitative analysis of mixtures.
      Forensic science: e.g. South African Police Force have used PolySNAP
        to match samples from
        crime scenes with a database of known samples. It is especially valuable
        when used with
        mineral theft.
    
    A Principal Scientist, Materials Science, at AstraZeneca explains the
      value of PolySNAP (Source
      5):
    "Identification of a suitable solid form for development of a
        crystalline material still remains a
        great challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Due to the different
        physical properties (e.g.,
        dissolution, stability) of different polymorphs, extensive screening is
        performed during the
        early stages of development to ensure the solid form architecture of the
        proposed molecule
        is fully understood and there have been a number of costly issues where
        compounds have
        had to be reformulated due to changes of form after launch.
    In screening for different solid forms, both manual and automated
        technologies have been
        utilised and a number of high throughput platforms have been developed
        that utilise common
        analytical techniques, e.g., PXRD for analysis of solid form. These
        techniques yield large
        quantities of analytical data which is quite difficult to comprehend and
        can rapidly overwhelm
        operators with excessive data. [...] PolySNAP utilises a wide range of
        mathematical
        techniques to help manage large data sets and successfully guides the
        scientists into not
        only the presence of the different forms but, more importantly, how
        these forms have been
        manufactured and hence how they can be controlled. It provides a range
        of pattern-matching
        methods and allows the user to have full control over understanding the
        date avoiding `black
        box' type results leaving the operator in control and reducing large
        datasets to a much
        smaller number of samples which require interpretation by scientists.
        The results from
        PolySNAP allow rapid identification of `safe' areas of working (e.g.,
        solvents, temperature,
        concentrations, etc.) and where further understanding is required. Most
        recently, the extra
        dimension of adding the capability of other analytical data (e.g.,
        spectroscopic) has provided
        further confidence and opportunities in the pattern matching."
    A one-month trial version of the PolySNAP software is available from
      WestCHEM, accompanied by
      a tutorial and trial data (Source 6).
    Visualising the Cambridge Structural Database with dSNAP
      The WestCHEM research that led to PolySNAP also underpinned a free
      computer program called
      dSNAP (Source 7) that classifies and visualises the results of searches on
      the Cambridge
      Structural Database (CSD), a repository of over 500,000 crystal structures
      derived from x-ray and
      neutron diffraction. The CSD is by far the most important source of
      structural data for small
      molecules, but while it is easy to search this database, it can be a
      problem to interpret the results.
      dSNAP is an important tool for this. dSNAP simplifies the problem using
      the same methodology as
      PolySNAP: it clusters the search results into groups that are very similar
      and thus allows the user
      to treat the group as a single entity so reducing the number of structures
      that need to examined.
      Additional tools are provided to assist in this. A confidential list of
      166 licensed dSNAP users up to
      2010 is available (Source 2).

    Context
      The research undertaken at WestCHEM addresses the problem of analysing
      large quantities data
      from x-ray powder diffraction and one-dimensional spectroscopic data, in
      particular, from Raman
      and IR spectroscopy [1,5]. In commercial research settings, it is now
      routine to collect thousands of
      x-ray powder-diffraction patterns in a day using crystallisation robots
      and a fast powder
      diffractometer. Many pharmaceutical and materials laboratories carry out
      such work routinely, one
      example being in the pharmaceutical industry where companies need to find
      all the possible
      polymorphs of a drug candidate both to protect their intellectual property
      and to ensure that more
      efficacious forms are not excluded. Using crystallisation robots,
      thousands of potential polymorphs
      are crystallised in small quantities and subjected to x-ray powder
      diffraction and, if possible, to
      Raman spectroscopy.
    Key Research Outcomes
      The motivation for the research carried out at WestCHEM was to explore
      ways to classify the data
      automatically and to provide associated data visualisation tools. The
      PolySNAP software classifies
      the patterns automatically using cluster analysis and multivariate
      statistics showing groups of
      patterns that are similar and thus belong to the same polymorph as well as
      highlighting new
      patterns that do not match the library of known forms [2-4]. From its
      first release, PolySNAP's
      approach has been revolutionary in that it uses every measured data point,
      whereas previously
      software used only the heights and positions of the top 5-10 peaks [6].
      This makes it far more
      robust in its statistics especially with regard to poor quality data,
      which are common in high-
      throughput studies.
    The WestCHEM research has led to a new integrated approach to full
      powder-diffraction pattern
      analysis. It incorporated wavelet-based data pre-processing, parametric
      and non-parametric
      statistical tests for full-pattern matching, and singular-value
      decomposition to extract quantitative
      phase information from mixtures. Every measured data point is used in both
      qualitative and
      quantitative analyses. The success of this new integrated approach was
      demonstrated through
      examples using several test data sets [6].
    Key researchers
      The initial research was carried out at WestCHEM under a grant from the
      Ford Motor Company
      (USA and Germany) starting in 2000. Major developments were commissioned
      by Pfizer in Kent
      and involved Professor Chris Gilmore (Prof at WestCHEM 1973-2010) along
      with Dr Gordon Barr
      (PDRA at WestCHEM 2002-10), and Dr Wei Dong (PDRA at WestCHEM 2003-07).
      Grants and
      other income continued from various sources until 2010 including an EPSRC
      Adventurous
      Research in Chemistry grant (2006).

    Process from research to impact: The Strathclyde team maximised
      the economic impact resulting from its research through a series of
      coordinated steps:
    
      Instigating and then collaborating on the development and
          commercialisation of new diamond product lines, by iterative
          diagnostic assessment and proving the material in key applications.
      Pioneering a diamond-enabled laser technology that was subsequently
          commercialised.
      Developing a diamond etch process [text removed for publication].
      Identifying and developing the novel laser architectures needed to
          enable new markets for diamond in photonics, for example as
          heatspreaders in semiconductor disk lasers.
    
    This impact was developed in partnership with Element Six Ltd,
      drawing on their world-leading diamond growth capability. The Strathclyde
      team stimulated interest in, and then contributed to the development of
      new diamond product lines by proactively taking to Element Six the
      requirement for lower birefringence and absorption along with an
      appreciation of the markets such material would address. Strathclyde and
      Element Six then worked together on an iterative process of diagnostic
      assessment and growth development. The Strathclyde team proved the
      efficacy of the resulting new material in disk (2008) and Raman lasers
      (2011), effectively completing a major design cycle and directly enabling
      new product lines for the company. (Sources A2 and D1)
      The team was instrumental in building four substantial academic/industrial
      collaborative projects: `NATAL' and `VERTIGO' (EU-funded); `ALFONSO' and
      `MIDDI' (DTI-funded). These involved working with companies such as Osram,
      Toptica, LISA-LASER, Cablefree,
      and Element Six to transfer to industry the technology
      that was subsequently commercialised.
    In parallel, the Strathclyde team identified the barriers to the
      commercial uptake of diamond in photonics and the need for laser designs
      that fully exploited the exceptional properties of diamond, putting in
      place research programmes to overcome these hurdles. The Strathclyde team
      postulated and then proved the efficacy of high optical quality diamond in
      advanced laser applications, and scoped the markets for diamond-enabled
      laser technologies. This included consultancy to scope the technological
      challenges and market potential for diamond Raman lasers, influencing
      Element Six's investment in this area. The Strathclyde team was also the
      academic partner on the DTI-funded `MIDDI' project (with Element Six)
      that developed a precise etching technique [Reference 3]. [text removed

    Reach and Significance of the Impact:
      a Sales Growth: [text removed for publication] head of the optical
      business unit at Element Six, notes that "we have had a number of
        experiences in recent years of existing and potential new customers
        approaching us quoting results from Strathclyde". This growth is
      driven by the world leading optical quality of Element Six's single
      crystal material, where the material and markets (for example
      semiconductor disk lasers) were developed with support from the
      Strathclyde team (Source D1).
    b Improved Products &amp;#8212; Diamond: Collaborative research with
      Strathclyde has enabled Element Six to introduce new CVD
      diamond product lines (2010-2012) to address markets in 1) Raman crystals
      for frequency shifting of established laser systems, 2) intracavity
      cooling elements for solid state disk lasers to enable higher power
      systems, and 3) intracavity coolers for semiconductor disk lasers,
      improving longevity and efficiency. [text removed for publication]
      Element Six's website notes the importance to these markets of reductions
      in loss and birefringence (areas worked on with Strathclyde &amp;#8212; References
      5, 6), since this material is "particularly suited for the most
        demanding optical applications", and that key markets include areas
      pioneered by Strathclyde: "novel laser technologies, including
        semiconductor and doped dielectric disk lasers" [References 1,2,4,6]
      and "Raman laser applications" [Ref 6]. Photonics is the fastest
      growing sector of the CVD diamond business according to Adrian Wilson,
      Head of Technologies at Element Six (quoted in Electro-optics magazine,
      July 2012). (Sources: D1, A2 and C).
    c Improved Products - Lasers: M Squared Lasers Ltd entered
      the marketplace for diamond- enabled lasers in 2012 with the purchase of Solus
          Technologies Ltd. These lasers utilise the intracavity diamond
      heat spreader technology pioneered at Strathclyde [References 1,2,4,5] for
      markets including high volume printing, semiconductor metrology and
      scientific instrumentation. [text removed for publication] Business
      Development Manager at M Squared Lasers Ltd, notes that "the
        pioneering research at Strathclyde on diamond-enabled lasers has been
        influential in opening up a valuable new market for M Squared Lasers
        Ltd" (Source D2).

    Context:
      Market requirements for developments in solid-state lasers focus on
      improved functionality - for example, by increasing wavelength coverage,
      while increasing the output power. This requires a step change in thermal
      engineering to manage greater heat deposition in the laser material when
      operated at higher powers. To achieve this, Strathclyde has pioneered the
      use of high optical quality synthetic diamond, which has a thermal
      conductivity almost 100 times that of current optical materials. This
      required improvements in the optical quality of synthetic diamond and the
      development of laser architectures that enable diamond to efficiently
      extract heat from a conventional laser material or to be used as a laser
      material in its own right.
    Key Findings:
    
      
Identifying and Proving Key Opportunities (2003-present): The
        Strathclyde team was the first to demonstrate (2004 [1]) and then fully
        analyse (2005 [2]) the use of diamond as a heat spreader within the
        cavity of a semiconductor disk laser. This reduced the temperature rise
        within the laser material and enabled the team to demonstrate watt-level
        output powers at 0.67&amp;#181;m (2005), 1.05&amp;#181;m (2006), 1.32&amp;#181;m (2004), 2.0&amp;#181;m
        (2009) and 2.35&amp;#181;m (2007). Prior to this, semiconductor disk lasers with
        output powers in excess of a few hundred milliwatts had only been
        demonstrated between 0.9 and 1.103bcm. This work was undertaken with a
        range of partners, both industrial (e.g. Samsung, Osram,
        FujiFilm) and academic (e.g. Fraunhofer IAF, Tampere,
        Sheffield, whose expertise was in III-V semiconductor growth, not
        diamond and its use), helping seed the growth of a world-wide
        semiconductor disk laser community. The Strathclyde team demonstrated
        that these lasers are ideal for nonlinear frequency conversion to
        address an even wider range of wavelengths and hence applications,
        demonstrating an ultra-violet system (2006) [3] and their first use to
        pump optical parametric oscillators (2009) and Raman lasers (2011). The
        team's Raman lasers were the first demonstrations of diamond as a laser
        material in its own right in a continuously operating laser - a route by
        which diamond's exceptional thermal properties can be more fully
        exploited to improve the output power of lasers in the future [6].
      
Developing and Proving Enabling Material (2006-present): The
        Strathclyde team identified deficiencies that severely limited the
        market potential of existing diamond: birefringence (2006) and loss
        (2011). They then worked closely with the manufacturer (Element
            Six Ltd) on an iterative process of diagnostic assessment
        (Strathclyde), growth development (Element Six Ltd) and demonstration of
        critical function (Strathclyde) in disk (2008) [5] and Raman lasers
        (2011) [6]. This process resulted in &amp;gt;100-fold reductions in the
        levels of loss and birefringence achievable simultaneously, which in
        turn enabled the demonstrations of critical function.
      
Demonstrating Vital Micro-fabrication Capability (2003-present):
        Having identified the potential of diamond for integrated photonics and
        electronics, the team developed (2006) a precise argon-chlorine
        inductively coupled plasma etch giving unprecedentedly low surface
        roughness (&amp;lt;0.2nm) [3], which was then patented (WO/2008/090511).
        This was used to fabricate high-quality micro-lenses (2006) [3],
        transistors (2008), and waveguides (2011).
    
    Key Researchers at University of Strathclyde: At the time of the
      research (2003-2013), the team was led by Professor Martin Dawson (Chair)
      with key contributions from Drs David Burns (2003-2012), Erdan Gu,
      Jennifer Hastie, Stephane Calvez (2003-2012), Alan Kemp, and John- Mark
      Hopkins (2003-2012). All were University of Strathclyde employees at
      Professorial or Research Fellow level.

    Process/Events from Research to Impact:
    Hayward created the start-up company Alba Ultrasound in 2000, to pursue
      the commercial application of his research. From 2000 - 2005 the main
      focus of the company was to design and manufacture the sonar array suite
      for the UK mine hunting fleet, [text removed for publication]. This system
      was the world's first ever wideband sonar capable of performing location,
      identification and classification from a single system. Each sonar array
      comprises many, sometimes thousands, of individual transducer elements,
      arranged so that the sound beam can be moved around under control of the
      electronics in the sonar unit. Moving the sonar beam this way enables
      images of the underwater scene to be developed in real time. It was
      acclaimed as the best sonar system in the world (Defence Preview, April
      2004).
    The initial research was not only instrumental in establishing Alba's
      commercial relationship [text removed for publication], but has continued
      to contribute to the growth of the company. The collaboration between the
      company and the University of Strathclyde continued after 2000 through a
      KTP programme, collaborative grants and key scientific outputs (Source A).
      The recent expansion of the company also has its roots in the success of
      this long-term partnership. The Managing Director of Alba Ultrasound has
      noted that `The basic research at Strathclyde has been a key element in
        the uptake of piezocomposite technology and this is widely recognised by
        the worldwide community' (Source B). The research undertaken at the
      University of Strathclyde has generated a platform of design tools and
      critical understanding to enable Alba to develop its range of world
      leading wide bandwidth sonar arrays. During 2005 - 2008, the research
      conducted by Hayward and CUE produced ground-breaking innovations in the
      company's product range which helped to realise a range of
      sensitivity-bandwidth properties which were previously unachievable.
    Types of Impact
    Expansion of Alba Ultrasound Ltd: Since 2008, Alba has undergone a
      significant expansion in business, primarily associated with
      diversification into commercial sonar markets, including underwater
      surveying, sea bed mapping, intruder detection systems and guidance of
      underwater vehicles. [text removed for publication]
    In 2009, the company moved into new state-of-the-art customised premises
      in the North of Glasgow, which provided the environment to enable a step
      change in the production output. Subsequently, turnover has increased
      almost linearly from &amp;#163;0.75M in 2007 to &amp;#163;3.8M by the end of June 2013 and
      the business is growing rapidly, with an employee count of 45 in June 2013 - an increase of 200% from the start of 2008. The collaboration with the
      Centre for Ultrasonic Engineering has provided a conduit for 4 highly
      skilled researchers into Alba in both project management and senior
      engineer roles.
    Sales and exports: Alba's key differentiator in the transducer
      manufacturing sector is the design of bespoke array transducers to match
      the wide range of applications associated with their worldwide customer
      base. Approximately 70% of Alba's products were exported in 2012. By July
      2013 in the region of 15% of the company's sales were in the
      military/naval sector, and the remaining 85% of sales to other commercial
      sonar manufacturing companies. The company has strategic, long term
      relationships with a range of clients [text removed for publication].
    Improved and innovative products: Sonar systems incorporating
      Alba's wideband array products enable higher resolution images to be
      realised which contribute to improved understanding of marine
      environments. Alba incorporated the outcomes of fundamental research
      undertaken at Strathclyde into their design process leading to products
      that are able to operate efficiently across extended bandwidths from a
      single device. This has revolutionised the mode of operation for sonar
      systems, as not only can a single device be driven at high power for
      enhanced propagation distances, but the ability to control the drive
      frequency provides the capability of switching from object detection (use
      of low frequencies, with low resolution) to object classification (using
      the higher resolution afforded by the smaller wavelengths associated with
      high frequency wave propagation). The application of advanced coded
      excitation waveforms within these sonar systems was a consequence of the
      uniform transducer behaviour achieved over extended bandwidths which, in
      turn, permitted the implementation of advanced signal and image processing
      techniques. The company received the Queen's Award for Innovation in 2012
      (Source D).
    Alba Ultrasound manufactures high end, bespoke transducer array products
      for the following applications; side scan and bathymetric sonar, mine
      hunting, high frequency imaging, intruder detection, autonomous underwater
      vehicles, remotely operated vehicles and hull mounted sonar systems
      (Source E). The clients who purchase Alba's arrays are companies who in
      turn manufacture the electronics and display systems for the complete
      sonar product, which is then sold on to the end-users. Each Alba 'product'
      is tailored to the requirements of an individual client and its particular
      sonar system.
    Contribution to the commercial success of other companies: The
      research conducted in collaboration with the University of Strathclyde
      during 2008-13 has directly led to a range of Alba products which have had
      a beneficial effect on the global sonar market. In addition to the mine
      hunting arrays, Alba products [text removed for publication]...enabling
      underwater tasks to be carried out more safely and with minimal damage to
      the affected areas (Source G). This is achieved through the provision of
      highly detailed images in sub-sea surveying which permits more accurate
      classification of structures such as shipwrecks, harbour installations and
      pipelines. [text removed for publication]
    Minimising negative impact on marine environment: The advanced
      sonar imaging systems deployed by various commercial and military
      operators have been made possible by the research-based Alba products.
      Alba's transducer arrays are designed to operate well above the acoustic
      frequency range of Cetacean species, including whales and dolphins. The
      company has conducted in-house testing which has shown the effects of its
      sonar on marine mammals to be minimal.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    A significant body of research in ultrasonics at the University of
      Strathclyde led to the formation of Alba Ultrasound Limited in 2000. This
      successful UK engineering manufacturing company designs and manufactures
      high quality wideband ultrasonic array transducers for sonar applications
      to a worldwide client base, delivering benefits ranging from naval and
      maritime security through to safer ocean environments and informed
      exploitation of marine resources. Alba Ultrasound's unique array
      transducers constitute the sensor front-end in many leading sonar systems,
      and its innovative products are incorporated in a range of sonar devices
      used by the military and commercial companies. Through application of
      Strathclyde research, the company has experienced a significant period of
      growth during 2008-2013, with a three-fold increase in employees and
      turnover rising from &amp;#163;750k to &amp;#163;3.8M.

    Context: From 1993 Professor Gordon Hayward was based in the
      Centre for Ultrasonic Engineering (CUE) within the Department of
      Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) where he undertook fundamental
      research into sonar transducers. The research was supported by a range of
      funded programmes, including EPSRC grants and research contracts from the
      US Office of Naval Research and the UK Ministry of Defence. In 2000,
      Hayward formed a start-up company Alba Ultrasound, while continuing as a
      full-time academic in the EEE Department. Hayward's research from 2000
      focussed on demonstrating the transducer technology in underwater
      applications such as sonar systems in submarines and other vessels, where
      reliability in harsh marine environments, wideband operation, high power
      handling and cost-effectiveness are essential requirements.
    Key Findings: A series of key research findings have informed the
      transducer design process at Alba Ultrasound. The breakthrough technology
      behind Alba's transducer arrays utilises a two-phase piezoelectric
      material, comprising a matrix of active piezoelectric ceramic pillars,
      embedded within a passive polymer phase [1] in a 1-3 composite structure.
      This structure has to then be encapsulated within a bespoke housing,
      incorporating additional backing and matching layers in order to optimize
      the transducer array's performance for a specific application. A detailed
      understanding of the multitude of resonance mechanisms associated with
      such a complex structure is critical in the design of truly wideband
      transducer arrays. In-depth knowledge of the interaction between the
      active and passive phases in 1-3 connectivity piezoelectric ceramic
      composite configurations ensures that no parasitic resonant modes appear
      in the desired operational frequency bandwidth of an array. Fundamental
      research undertaken during the period 1993-1999 provided significant
      advancement in the understanding of these complex interactions inherent in
      the composite transducer microstructure and included: design guidelines
      for the polymer passive phase in the 1-3 composite microstructure [1];
      consideration of the complex interaction between the active and passive
      phases to maximise transducer efficiency [2]; and development of new
      polymer materials to minimise mechanical cross-talk in ultrasonic array
      devices, which is a source of image degradation in sonar systems [3].
      Additional insight into the thermal behaviour of 1-3 composite transducers
      proposed the use of loaded polymers to extend the maximum operating
      temperature, which is important in high power sonar applications [4].
      Moreover, when configured as an array transducer, these composite
      microstructures have a double periodicity through the composite matrix
      substrate and the array element configuration, further complicating the
      design process. Reference 5 is a two part paper that introduced a new
      understanding of the parasitic resonance modes in these structures and
      offered the potential to design truly wideband sonar arrays [5]. During
      this period, Alba and CUE collaborated on a KTP project which investigated
      the use of new, single-crystal piezoelectric materials in composite
      transducer designs, yielding enhancements in both sensitivity and
      bandwidth over composite devices incorporating conventional piezoceramic
      materials [6]. Thus the research, which has concentrated on understanding
      the fundamental resonance mechanisms between the two constituent materials
      within the composite matrix substrate with control of the polymer phase
      [1,3,4] and the ceramic dimensions [2,5,6], is at the heart of Alba's
      efficient unimodal piezocomposite transducer designs. A key element in
      extending this piezoelectric technology into array structures was provided
      by the seminal work regarding the presence of Lamb waves due to
      periodicity in both the matrix substrate and array layout [5].

    The research has had global impact in three areas &amp;#8212; the development and
      testing of a FRMS; campaigns against the liberalisation of EU FTLs; and
      (on-going) campaigns by the Society for the Welfare of Indian Pilots
      against similar liberalisation proposals.
    The night-freight airline, aware of Bennett's research, asked him to
      tailor the FRMS model to accommodate the fatigue-risk management needs of
      a night-freight operator. To refine the FRMS Bennett conducted surveys
      throughout his 3.5 years at the airline. The design of the FRMS involved
      modification of the standard International Civil Aviation Organization
      model to accommodate intense night operations through the circadian low.
      The adaptive work drew on Bennett's research into flight-deck labour.
      Testing and refinement of the system was based on his involvement as an
      action-researcher. Bennett's participant observation/action research
      approach helped maintain pilot engagement which assisted in the
      identification of feedback problems in the standard FRMS system. Without
      feedback FRMS becomes a source of risk.
    The development of a FRMS allowed the airline to verify and fine-tune
      rosters. It enabled the development and validation of a variation that
      satisfied both the CAA's safety criteria and the airline's operational
      requirements. Data generated by the FRMS was used to optimise the
      trans-Atlantic rosters such that an acceptable safety margin was
      maintained. Bennett's work (validated by the CAA) laid the foundations for
      a `virtuous circle' of research. Because they required the introduction of
      the new, larger Boeing 767F, the trans-Atlantic services revolutionised
      the airline's operations. For example, instead of a crew heading to Italy
      on the same day they were due to operate from that country, they were
      flown out the day before, allowing them to sleep prior to their duty.
      After this roster change, the FRMS confirmed the beneficial impact on
      fatigue levels (fewer fatigue reports were filed for this duty). Bennett
      confirmed the safety benefits of new facilities (like a new sleeping
      facility at the airline's Italian hub and expanded accommodation at its
      German hub).
    The night-freight FRMS research attracted BALPA's attention, who
      commissioned Bennett to further investigate the pilot lifestyle. BALPA has
      10,000 members. Bennett had contributed to BALPA's journals for over a
      decade and his report The Pilot Lifestyle was distributed to the
      European Commission, European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), ICAO,
      International Air Transport Association (IATA), CAA, Members of the
      European Parliament, Members of the UK Parliament, airline managements,
      pilots, civil servants, journalists and trade unions. Bennett engaged with
      opinion-formers and decision-makers, in 2011 attending a Parliamentary
      Reception to bring this research to the attention of Ministers. Since
      publication of The Pilot Lifestyle Bennett has contributed to the
      media debate (via, for example, the newspaper Politiken and a lead
      news item for the Danish Broadcasting Corporation in June 2013, a Channel
      4 documentary in July 2013). He has corresponded with the British Prime
      Minister, the Minister of State for Transport, the Chair of the Transport
      Select Committee, the CAA's Head of Safety Strategy, the Chief Executive
      of the United Kingdom Flight Safety Committee, the Chairman of the All
      Party Parliamentary Group for Freight Transport and the Executive Director
      of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety. The EU
      campaigns included the writing of papers that were strongly informed by
      Bennett's research. An example is a lobby paper written by Bennett for the
      Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (Contemporary
        issues: Fatigue impacts of employee commutes). An example of a
      position paper is that written for a Parliamentary Reception hosted by
      BALPA (Executive summary of The Pilot Lifestyle: a sociological study
        of the commercial pilot's work and home life). The Indian campaigns
      included the publication of a report by Moebus Aviation on behalf of SWIP.
      Bennett contributed a chapter to the report.
    Documents and presentations made by BALPA and Bennett were part of a
      campaign to show that the harmonisation of standards in the EU would relax
      rather than improve them. Bennett's main contributions were The Pilot
        Lifestyle and his contribution to the position paper The Next
        Chapter. He published summaries of his BALPA-funded research
      throughout 2011 and 2012 (in the Flight Safety Foundation's AeroSafety
        World, the Royal Aeronautical Society's The Aerospace
        Professional and the UK Flight Safety Committee's Focus on
        Commercial Aviation Safety). Bennett's action-research made him an
      actor in BALPA's campaign against the harmonisation of EU FTLs. In a
      letter, BALPA's Head of Flight Safety said: "I am pleased to say your work
      has importantly informed the current BALPA Safety Plan and also the
      current House of Commons Select Committee enquiry into pilot fatigue."
      Further union work, specifically participation in the UK Independent
      Pilots' Association campaign video Pilot Fatigue: Is Your Captain Awake?
      The documentary drew on his research findings and featured Bennett talking
      about the factors that induce pilot fatigue. The BBC approached Bennett
      for an interview. A former Training Captain wrote to Bennett: "I would
      like to congratulate you on your crystal-clear analysis of the fatigue
      issue in the IPA pilot fatigue film; very well done."
    Bennett's publications and his work for BALPA and the night-freight
      airline attracted the attention of Moebus Aviation, a consultancy engaged
      by the Society for the Welfare of Indian Pilots to help it campaign for
      safe FTLs. Bennett contributed a 950-word critique of the FRMS methodology
      (`Fatigue-risk management systems &amp;#8212; requirements for successful
      operation') to Moebus Aviation's 2012 report.
    In the Summer of 2012 Bennett secured a 12-month research placement with
      British Airways World Cargo (BAWC). The airline's ultra long-haul (ULH)
      operation will add a new dimension to Bennett's research and produce
      further impact in the future.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Flight safety has been a major focus in the past sixteen years at the
      Civil Safety and Security Unit (CSSU), affiliated with the University of
      Leicester's School of Management. The knowledge created has had three
      impacts. First, the development of a tailored fatigue-risk management
      system (FRMS) now in operation in a night-freight airline. FRMS provides
      for the development and validation of rosters that optimise crews'
      economic and safety performance, saving lives and money. Until this
      research no UK-registered night-freight airline had operated a FRMS.
      Second, the research underpins the evidence-base for the British Air Line

        wide-ranging study of modern airline crew lifestyle, and its potential
        effects on pilot competency. This will examine the effects of numerous
        factors, like the increasing need for pilots to commute long distances
        to work, and the stresses caused by high levels of personal debt
        resulting from the fact that pilots increasingly pay for all their

    Improving Airline Safety through the Analysis of Pilot Fatigue
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Business and Management Studies</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    CSSU has an international reputation for risk management expertise. The
      research underpinning the impacts was carried out at the University of
      Leicester, in part funded by BALPA who awarded &amp;#163;53k to Dr Simon Bennett
      (Leicester since 1992) to research the pilot lifestyle. It was conducted
      in three overlapping phases. Between 1998 and 2013 Bennett conducted much
      research into the safety impacts of stress and fatigue. Between January
      2008 and June 2011, this knowledge was used to develop a bespoke FRMS for
      a night-freight airline. Prior to this FRMSs had been used mainly in
      passenger airlines. The unique aspect of night-freight is that all
      services are operated through the circadian low. The chosen airline was
      known for its roster volatility. Finally, between November 2010 and April
      2011 a study of pilot lifestyle was initiated by the British Air Line
      Pilots' Association (BALPA).
    The initiative for each phase was the previous phase and the knowledge
      creation itself an impact of the original research. The project began as a
      normal social scientific study, Mode 1 science in Gibbons et al's
      terms, but developed through a participant observation/action research
      study into Mode 2, in which knowledge emerged in the context of
      application. The research was unique because it correlated stress and
      fatigue with pilot lifestyle.
    In phase one, the major findings (1, 2, 3) of the research were that:
    a) flight-crew represent a peripatetic workforce &amp;#8212; a `pilot diaspora' &amp;#8212;
      for which commute-to-work distances are increasing
    b) the peripatetic lifestyle causes physical and psychological stress
    c) such stresses can impact a pilot's working and home life
    d) context-sensitive rostering can help mitigate stresses and reduce
      turnover (and costs)
    e) pilots need to `unburden'
    f) pilots constitute a committed, cohesive and mutually-supportive
      work-group
    g) managers should work with, rather than against this strong flight-deck
      culture
    Phase two involved a three-and-a-half year research partnership with a
      night-freight airline (4, 5). First, ethnographic research recorded the
      `lived experience' of flight-deck labour and other methods included: a
      sleep-diary study; analysis of Mandatory Occurrence Reports; the
      post-incident debriefing of pilots; participant observation of flight-deck
      operations and the down-route lifestyle; interviews. Bennett delivered
      initial FRMS training to pilots and managers, analysed Crew Fatigue
      Reports and made recommendations. His on-going research &amp;#8212; particularly
      into the effects of changes to rosters and positioning practices on
      fatigue and efficiency &amp;#8212; was used to optimise the system. The research
      found that:
    a) Commute-to-work times impacted pilots' physical and psychological
      health and fatigue levels
    b) Pressure on bottom-end salaries left some pilots unable to afford
      convenient accommodation
    c) Consequences included arduous commutes and inappropriate use of
      facilities equipped for napping. Acute/chronic fatigue as well as health,
      psychological and relationship problems resulted
    d) FRMS helped the airline identify and correct fatigue-inducing rosters
    e) Pilots form cohesive, self-reliant, norm-driven and
      mutually-supporting groups, even when there is no union representation
    f) Safety cannot be considered in isolation from other factors, like
      financial reward and the property market
    Phase 3 involved a social-psychological study of the commercial pilot
      lifestyle based on 433 questionnaire responses, 130 sleep diaries and
      interviews (6). The findings included that pilots:
    a) Perceived unsympathetic rostering to cause stress and fatigue
    b) Perceived the peripatetic lifestyle to cause stress, fatigue,
      low-morale, relationship problems and financial pain
    c) Believed a healthy reporting climate to be a prerequisite for the
      comprehensive and timely reporting of fatigue-risk
    d) Believed that under-reporting weakened FRMSs
    e) Attempted to keep fit despite being fatigued
    f) Tended not to trust airline authority figures and Aviation Medical
      Examiners
    g) Sometimes reported for work when they should have reported sick and
      sometimes reported sick when they were suffering acute or chronic fatigue
    h) Formed a cohesive work-group and believed that UK aviation is
      underappreciated

    The unique properties of PCFs (described above) open up new ways to
      manipulate and control light, benefiting applications such as medical
      imaging (eg. fluorescence lifetime imaging, optical coherence tomography
      and optical molecular imaging) [6], spectroscopy, physical and biomedical
      sensing [7], laser gyroscopes (used in critical navigation and defence
      systems) [8] and materials processing.
    Commercial activity at Bath began with several key patents filed from
      1998 with Birks, Knight and Russell as inventors [9]. Together with a Bath
      spin-out company BlazePhotonics, these patents were sold to Danish firm
      "Crystal Fibre" for $3.3M in 2004. Now part of NKT Photonics [10], Crystal
      Fibre's capability also derived directly from Bath know-how following our
      collaboration with its co- founder Broeng [2,11]. The PCFs sold by NKT
      Photonics during the REF period were therefore based on our original
      expertise and patents. The company also incorporate PCF as a key enabling
      component in many of their fibre laser products. In their 2010 Annual
      Report, NKT state that the "addressable market for crystal fibers is
      valued at around 200-400 mDKK annually" [12], equivalent to $35M-$70M
      annually. "Addressable market" is the total size of a market [13].
    CPPM remain engaged with the needs of industry and indeed some of NKT
      Photonics's newest custom fibre products were supplied directly by us
      under contract. Commenting on this deal, the CEO of NKT Photonics said "We
      are pleased that we can continue to serve our customers with these leading
      edge fibers, and along with the help and expertise of the University of
      Bath, demonstrate our continued leadership and commitment in the area of
      hollow core fibers" [11].
    Several other companies sell systems incorporating types of PCFs
      invented, designed and demonstrated by the Bath team, such as Leukos SA
      (France) [14] and B&amp;amp;W Tek (USA) [15]. A major PCF application is
      microscopy, and the market leading Leica TCS SP8 X confocal microscope
      employs PCF in the excitation source [16]. Another key application is the
      optical comb marketed by Menlo Systems for precision metrology and
      standardisation [17]. Menlo itself arose from the laboratory of one of our
      German collaborators, in part because of our contribution to the work for
      which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2005 [18]. The US military uses
      PCF for high-power military sensors and gyroscopes [19].
    Throughout the REF period, the leading optical components vendors Newport
      Corporation [20] and Thorlabs [21] sold "off-the-roll" PCFs made by
      BlazePhotonics and NKT Photonics and based on our designs. They offered 15
      and 25 PCF products respectively, priced between &amp;#163;80 and &amp;#163;1100 per metre,
      for a variety of industrial and academic applications such as those
      described above.

      Photonic crystal fibres represent a revolutionary waveguide technology
        that was pioneered and developed by the University of Bath team
      Their unique properties have a multitude of applications
      Businesses derived directly or indirectly from our research outputs

    Photonic crystal fibres (PCFs) are optical fibres incorporating
      carefully-controlled patterns of microscopic air holes. They have
      characteristics that are impossible in conventional fibres, such as the
      ability to guide light along a hollow core (see figure). The fibre's
      inventors Birks, Knight and Russell&amp;#167; established what is now
      the Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials (CPPM) at the University
      of Bath in 1996. They were later joined by Wadsworth, Benabid and Skryabin&amp;#167;.
      This group pioneered the design and fabrication of these fibres with
      funding from DERA Malvern, EPSRC and JIF and support from the University
      of Bath. They have led what has since developed into a continuing
      worldwide academic research field and industrial technology.

The cross section of a hollow-core PCF developed at Bath

	  The research took place from 1996 and continues to this day. Key
      scientific milestones underpinning the impact include:
    
      Demonstration and understanding of endlessly single-mode PCFs, which
        propagate light of any wavelength at a well-defined speed [1]. All
        conventional fibres are only single-mode over a limited range of
        wavelengths, leading sometimes to a poor profile for the delivered beam.
      Demonstration and understanding of low-loss optical fibres that guide
        light in a hollow core surrounded by a "photonic band gap" cladding
        [2-4]. This enables delivery of pulse lengths, optical powers and
        wavelengths, which are truly unthinkable using conventional fibres.
      Prediction and demonstration of the necessary properties for the
        control of strong non-linear interactions in PCFs [5]. This revitalised
        the field of nonlinear fibre optics, resulting in a range of
        technological and commercial developments as well as new scientific
        insights.

    Traditional laser light sources operate at a single wavelength and&#xD;
      consequently if a particular investigation requires multiple wavelengths,&#xD;
      the user has to buy and install a separate laser system for each. By&#xD;
      contrast, supercontinuum fibre lasers provide the directional beam and&#xD;
      tight focus of standard lasers, but with an exceptionally broad spectral&#xD;
      bandwidth. Although this comes at the cost of lower power compared to&#xD;
      single wavelength lasers, there are nevertheless a myriad of applications&#xD;
      requiring multiple wavelengths for which high power is not necessary. For&#xD;
      these a supercontinuum source provides an effective all-in-one solution in&#xD;
      which the wavelength is changed simply by inserting an appropriate filter.&#xD;
      Applications are found across microscopy, medical imaging and&#xD;
      spectroscopy, enabling experiments or analyses that would otherwise be&#xD;
      impossible or prohibitively expensive [9]. As such, there is a large and&#xD;
      rapidly expanding market for any company able to provide supercontinuum&#xD;
      fibre lasers having the right price and performance.&#xD;
    As a result of its collaboration with Bath researchers, Fianium [10,11]&#xD;
      is now firmly established as a world leader in supercontinuum sources,&#xD;
      with a [text removed for publication]. Following [text removed for publication] and in recognition of their&#xD;
      outstanding achievements in international trade and innovation, Fianium&#xD;
      received the Queen's Award for Enterprise in both 2009 and 2012 - the UK's&#xD;
      top award for business performance [13]. [text removed for publication]. The 2012 award&#xD;
      specifically recognises the innovation associated with Fianium's&#xD;
      supercontinuum sources. Since 2008, [text removed for publication] representing a&#xD;
      significant economic gain [12] (the R&amp;amp;D employment multiplier is 1.23,&#xD;
      while the output multiplier is 1.44 [14]).&#xD;
    Bath's CPPM is a world leader in fibre supercontinuum research, and&#xD;
      although not the only research team in this active field [text removed for publication].&#xD;
    The success of the early interaction with CPPM led to a joint DTI/TSB&#xD;
      project with Fianium between 2006 and 2008 [15]. The strengthened links&#xD;
      that ensued provided CPPM researchers with improved insight into the&#xD;
      commercial possibilities of supercontinuum fibres. In particular, Knight&#xD;
      and Wadsworth initiated research on how to extend the short wavelength&#xD;
      cut-off of the supercontinuum further into the blue end of the spectrum.&#xD;
      [text removed for publication]. An improved understanding of the non-linear optical physics&#xD;
      that underlies supercontinuum generation resulting from theoretical work&#xD;
      at CPPM (Skryabin [7]) led Knight in 2007/8 to design a new fibre that&#xD;
      reduced the short wavelength cut-off to 420 nm (ultraviolet) [5]. [text removed for publication].&#xD;
    Another TSB-funded project, Whitelase, between Fianium and the CPPM&#xD;
      (Knight, Wadsworth; 2008-2011 [8,15]) further extended the supercontinuum&#xD;
      into the deep ultraviolet (320 nm)[6] [text removed for publication]. Knowledge transfer&#xD;
      into engineered products has been facilitated by two KTP projects (Knight,&#xD;
      Wadsworth; 2011-2013) [text removed for publication]. In total, this investment revenue&#xD;
      amounts to [text removed for publication]. The on-going relationship between Fianium and&#xD;
      the CPPM has also been supported by licensing and consultancy agreements&#xD;

    The Bath research underpinning commercial supercontinuum began in 1998&#xD;
      with investigations into nonlinearity in new designs of optical fibres,&#xD;
      informed by previous theoretical studies of fibre dispersion by members&#xD;
      (Birks, Knight, Russell&amp;#167;) of Bath's Centre for Photonics and&#xD;
      Photonic Materials (CPPM)[1]. Stimulated by CPPM's work on new nonlinear&#xD;
      fibre designs, researchers elsewhere (Bell Laboratories, 1999)&#xD;
      demonstrated that these fibres could be used to transform ultrashort laser&#xD;
      pulses into a broad range of wavelengths covering the visible and&#xD;
      near-infrared, known as a supercontinuum. Similar work was already&#xD;
      underway at the CPPM and the first Bath paper on the subject appeared just&#xD;
      weeks later [2].&#xD;
    These early supercontinuum sources were very much laboratory experiments&#xD;
      requiring expensive and complex ultrashort pulse Ti:sapphire lasers.&#xD;
      However, Wadsworth&amp;#167; of the CPPM realised that far more&#xD;
      applications and far greater impact would be possible if the same results&#xD;
      could be obtained using the much simpler and cheaper technology of Nd or&#xD;
      Yb based lasers. This required the design of new fibres with dispersion&#xD;
      suited to the different laser wavelength, as well as an understanding of&#xD;
      how the physics of the generation would change from the ultrashort pulses&#xD;
      used originally, to longer (quasi-continuous) pulses [3].&#xD;
    In 2004, members of the CPPM (Wadsworth, Knight, Birks, Russell)&#xD;
      published a paper demonstrating supercontinuum with compact, long pulse,&#xD;
      Nd based lasers, which was also entirely compatible with the Yb based&#xD;
      fibre lasers being developed by Fianium at the time [4]. [text removed for publication] by&#xD;
      2005/06 Fianium were selling supercontinuum sources. With the potential&#xD;
      for further commercialisation opportunities obvious to both parties,&#xD;
      Fianium and CPPM researchers embarked on an enthusiastic and fruitful&#xD;
      collaboration. By working closely with researchers in Bath's CPPM, Fianium&#xD;
      Ltd. has been able to understand, influence and licence developments in&#xD;
      supercontinuum laser technology to bring new products to market rapidly.&#xD;
    Further research on supercontinuum has followed in Bath, including&#xD;
      extending the visible wavelength coverage across the blue [5] and then the&#xD;
      ultraviolet (320nm) [6]. Complementary theoretical work by Skryabin&amp;#167;&#xD;
      of the CPPM [7] has elucidated the physical processes controlling the&#xD;
      commercially important shortest wavelengths in the visible supercontinuum.&#xD;
      A key aim is to exploit the findings of this fundamental research to&#xD;
      develop routes to new technologies within the context of collaborative&#xD;
      research funded by the Technology Strategy Board (TSB)[8], Knowledge&#xD;
      Transfer Partnerships (KTP) and FP7.&#xD;

    The impact of the research undertaken at Aberdeen relates to
      practitioners and professional
      services, where professional and industry standards have been informed as
      a result of research
      findings. As stated by Professor R. D. Hooton, a world-leading contributor
      to the cement and
      construction industry in Canada: "... the Chemistry Department at the
        University of Aberdeen has
        made the biggest contributions globally to our understanding of both
        hydration of cements and
        fundamental understanding of durability of cementitious materials for
        use in concrete" [a].
    The key outcome of the particular research project as described was to
      inform
      international standards beyond the EU. As verified by the Portland Cement
      Association, the
      industry trade association for North America, "in the last several
        years, the US cement industry has
        made significant progress in its continuing efforts to improve the
        sustainability of the built
        environment, and a key component of that effort has been the development
        of specification
        requirements for Portland-limestone cements. After several years'
        effort, in 2012, US blended
        cement specifications were revised to include cements with up to 15%
        limestone. While other
        research has gone into this effort, a key component of the rationale
        supporting changes to both
        sets of specifications was results of your (Glasser) research related to
        the reactions that limestone
        undergoes during cement hydration, their volumetric changes, and the
        thermodynamic stability of
        the resulting phases. We continue to use the results of this research in
        the on-going educational
        efforts with specifiers, architects and engineers..." [b]. Dr
      Kosmatka further clarifies the overall
      economic impact implied by the benefits derived from this research: "It
        is difficult to estimate the
        economic impact of these changes for the concrete construction industry
        in the US. A roughly 10%
        saving with regard to CO2 and other emissions
        and energy has made the industry more efficient as
        well as more sustainable, both of which help the competitiveness in the
        roughly $19 billion (US)
        cement industry" [b].
    The impact of Glasser's work on the North American cement industry is
      further
      supported by Al Innis, Vice President of Holcim (US), who states "...The
        work you have done on
        limestone cements has been a key component in having the US standards
        accept blended
        cements containing up to 15% limestone. This change in standards gives
        our industry and Holcim
        (US) in particular the opportunity to provide our customers a higher
        quality product with a lower
        carbon footprint..." [c].
    In addition, to confirmation of new standards in the USA, specifications
      in Canada
      have also been developed. As Professor Hooton confirms: "The work by
        Matschei, Lothenbach
        and Glasser has been important for the understanding of
        Portland-limestone cements that led to
        their adoption in cement specifications in Canada (CSA A3000) in 2008
        and in the USA (ASTCM
        C595) in 2012. The use of these cements is now incorporated into the
        Canadian building codes,
        and their use is increasing" [a].
    Limestone addition to cement contributes to properties through three
      mechanisms:
      particle packing effects which reduce water demand, nucleation effects
      which accelerate hydration
      reactions, and production of carboaluminate phases which reduce porosity.
      According to a 2011
      State of the Art Report from the Portland Cement Association, Glasser's
      work "provided
        quantitative calculation of the phases that may be present...... a great
        step forward in
        understanding these systems" [d]
    The thermodynamic models derived from the research have now been
      incorporated
      into the GEMS suite (Gibbs Energy
      Minimization Software for
        Geochemical Modelling), originally
      developed by the Swiss Nuclear Organisation, and now managed by the Paul
      Scherrer Institute.
      Explicitly the research work has been fundamental to the CEMDATA07
      database, included in the
      GEMS TDB software package (GEMS Thermodynamic
      DataBase) [e]. Empa, who
      co-supervised
      the research project, confirm that the Aberdeen research was a fundamental
      component to the
      cement database "was published in 2007-2009 and based on work carried
        out at Empa
        (Lothenbach et al., 2008; M&amp;#246;schner et al. 2008, 2009; Schmidt et al.
        2008) and a PhD carried out
      both at the University of Aberdeen and at Empa (Matschei et al, 2008)"
      [f].
    In overall terms, the economic benefit is hard to calculate, although the
      saving in
      CO2 emissions is more straightforward. The world production of
      Portland cement is about 3 x109
      tonnes per year. If one third of this production uses 10% limestone
      replacement, and assuming
      production in efficient equipment, the net saving in CO2
      emissions is of the order of 85 million
      tonnes per year. From this has to be deducted the energy input of
      quarrying and grinding
      limestone, but this is comparatively low (only a few million tonnes per
      year), Thus a reduction of
      the order of 80 million tonnes per year carbon dioxide emission is
      achieved, with considerable
      scope for greater reductions still realisable as the process continues to
      gain traction.
    The International Energy Agency (IEA) has proposed strategies to reduce
      global
      CO2 emissions by 52% from 2007 to 2050 [g]. The so-called Blue
      Map Scenario places different
      requirements on different sectors of the global economy. The cement
      industry is required to reduce
      its CO2 emissions by 22.5% from 2007 to 2050. Limestone
      substitution in Portland cement at levels
      now shown by this work to be safe and reliable will achieve around 1/6th
      of the 450 million tonnes
      per year reduction in CO2 emissions required.
    Furthermore, the success of this project has led to financial support for
      bolder and
      more radical initiatives for reducing CO2 emissions from the
      cement industry. The Qatar
      Foundation has awarded a US$5.3M grant to the University of Aberdeen
      (together with the
      University of Dundee) to investigate further reductions in the CO2 input
      to structural concrete and
      increased functional performance of products. This project, which
      commenced in September 2012,
      is focussed on indigenous Gulf region resources. The project has at its
      heart development of two
      novel cements: one being a low carbon-input cement base of calcium
      sulphoaluminate, and a
      second carbon-negative cement type.

    This case study describes the impact on practitioners and services
      through the development of
      new international standards based on research at the University of
      Aberdeen on Portland-limestone
      cements undertaken in 2004-8. The findings of this research have been
      adopted into
      revised international specifications for Portland cement mixtures in the
      European Union, Canada
      and the United States. The findings have also been incorporated into an
      industry standard
      software package (CEMDATA) for modelling thermodynamic properties of
      cement mixture, now
      established as part of the GEMS software suite freely available.

    Cement research at Aberdeen began when HFW Taylor was appointed as a
      lecturer about 1950. A
      former student of the late J.D. Bernal FRS, Taylor took inspiration from
      Bernal's polymath
      approach to science and by demonstrating the application of crystal
      chemistry and structure to the
      hydration of cement, gave the subject new directions. Since Taylor's
      retirement about 1985 this
      work has been progressed by F.P. Glasser and D.E. Macphee. The importance
      of the work to
      science and industry has been recognised by (i) major research projects
      from the UK Environment
      Agency (at that time, HMIP and DoE) and the European Union, having as its
      objective providing a
      scientific basis for the immobilisation of nuclear waste in cement. This
      work is frequently cited
      today and forms an integral part of the safety case worldwide for
      radioactive waste immobilisation.
    The specific example of more recent work which has influenced industry
      and which forms the basis
      of this Case Study relates to the use of limestone (calcium carbonate) as
      a reactive supplement for
      Portland cement. Since the 1970's, the cement industry has come under
      increasing pressure to
      reduce its carbon dioxide emissions: one tonne of Portland cement is
      responsible for emission of
      ~850kg CO2 even with the best available abatement technology.
      By 1990 it was accepted on the
      basis of empirical evidence that adding c. 4-6% limestone to cement
      improved its strength and
      decreased product permeability. Up to 10-12% limestone by volume could be
      added without
      reducing properties to below those of equivalent mixes with 100% cement.
      The problem was that
      the evidence was statistical with a reasonable but not totally convincing
      probability. And it was
      insufficient to convince many sceptics of the need for change in an
      industry dominated by
      prescriptive specifications. Nevertheless, since limestone addition to
      cement reduces CO2
      emissions due to cement production (discounting the small energy cost of
      limestone production),
      the drive for the industry to reduce its CO2 emissions meant
      that more convincing evidence for the
      value of limestone addition was needed.
    In 2004 the Glasser group in Aberdeen began a research project dedicated
      to application of
      thermodynamics to cement hydration. The group had done pioneering work on
      the role of calcium
      carbonate in the hydration process [1]. However the lack of a good
      database meant that
      predictions were only semi- quantitative and only a coarse grid of
      relevant systems could be
      calculated. In 2003 Glasser successfully applied to Nanocem (a
      not-for-profit consortium financed
      by the European cement industry) to sponsor a project aimed at improving
      and applying a
      database for cementitious substances. As a demonstration example of the
      power of the new
      database and modern computation methods, calculations were undertaken and
      subsequently
      verified by targeted experiments, on phase relations in the CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-
      CaCO3-CaSO4-H2O
      system at 0-85&amp;#186;C. It was highly relevant because the benefit, if any, of
      adding limestone to cement
      was being hotly debated at the time.
    The calculations showed that the amount of CaCO3 which could
      react with cement at a particular
      temperature was quantitatively related to the Al2O3/sulphate
      molar ratio of the cement. Diagrams
      were devised allowing the optimum amount of reactive carbonate to be
      predicted from a two-dimensional
      plot requiring as input compositional data obtained from elemental
      analysis of the
      cement. Experimentally, it was shown that the predicted equilibria were
      attained within a few days.
      This work was first reported at a conference [2] and in an industrial
      journal [3], which presented the
      results and explained the basis of the calculation without thermodynamic
      details, in a manner
      accessible to engineers and stakeholders. Two full papers in the journal
      Cement and Concrete
      Research then presented the details of the thermodynamic modelling [4, 5].
      A subsequent paper
      has extended the modelling to include temperature dependence [6].
    The key outcome of this work is that the addition of CaCO3 can
      be optimised on a generic basis so
      as to shift most of the sulphate into ettringite, a low density calcium
      sulphoaluminate hydrate. This
      maximises conversion of liquid water to crystal water, thereby also
      optimising space filling by solids
      and reducing cement matrix porosity. This enables a win-win situation to
      be attained: reducing
      clinker contents, with their high CO2 liberation, and also
      improving product durability in a wide
      range of aggressive service environments.
    Such modification of the hydrate phase assemblage has mainly been used in
      the cement industry
      to maximise CO2 reduction by increasing substitution of cement
      by limestone, while maintaining
      engineering properties such as strength and porosity, to those which would
      be obtained in cement-only
      formulations. This has led the industry to rely less on empiricism and
      more on science-based
      approaches to improve cement properties and reduce emissions.
      Thermodynamic treatments are
      now routinely being extended to optimise production parameters at the
      hydration stage.

    BU's practice development approach is now widely used in England (R1)&#xD;
      with further evidence of&#xD;
      use in Australia (R2). This helps health and social care practitioners to&#xD;
      use the best available&#xD;
      evidence to develop their practice and ensure their care is effective and&#xD;
      person focused.Through&#xD;
      the practice development process and accreditation teams work towards&#xD;
      developing a culture of&#xD;
      excellence by becoming person-centred and introducing evidence-based&#xD;
      practice through&#xD;
      effective culture change and teamwork. Teams are encouraged to question&#xD;
      and challenge current&#xD;
      practice and, by using evidence, improve services. Each PDU must&#xD;
      demonstrate:&#xD;
    - An understanding of the service user needs and clear mechanisms for&#xD;
      communicating and&#xD;
      listening to users and carers.&#xD;
    - How developments are researched, evidence-based, evaluated and&#xD;
      disseminated to&#xD;
      demonstrate best practice and to contribute to the local, national and&#xD;
      international&#xD;
      evidence base.&#xD;
    - A clear action plan that outlines the aims for development of services&#xD;
      and team members&#xD;
      that has links to national and local host organisation's priorities.&#xD;
    - A leadership structure that supports the delivery and development of&#xD;
      multi-agency inter-&#xD;
      professional care in line with the action plan.&#xD;
    - A defined communication structure to ensure the collaboration of team&#xD;
      members and the&#xD;
      provision of effective inter-professional care.&#xD;
    - A clear understanding of the user journey and understanding of the team&#xD;
      member's&#xD;
      contribution to the success of the user experience.&#xD;
    - How services have been developed taking a `whole systems' approach,&#xD;
      ensuring the entire&#xD;
      user journey is improved.&#xD;
    - Clear partnerships with an academic department and other agencies&#xD;
      required to support&#xD;
      research and the dissemination of best practice.&#xD;
    This explicit set of standards is then assessed by a panel of external&#xD;
      experts from practice and&#xD;
      academia who examine a portfolio of evidence and visit the unit to observe&#xD;
      and speak to service&#xD;
      users, carers and staff. Units are reaccredited on a three-yearly basis to&#xD;
      ensure high standards are&#xD;
      maintained.&#xD;
    Since 2008, BU researchers have facilitated the set-up and accreditation&#xD;
      of 47 PDUs and&#xD;
      reaccreditation of 35 (Fig. 1), working with 82 units in total. This&#xD;
      covers 6 counties in the UK (Fig.&#xD;
      2), including 8 NHS Trusts serving a resident population of over 3.5&#xD;
      million (R3). Units accredited&#xD;
      and reaccredited include social services departments, dementia services&#xD;
      and children's units (R4).&#xD;
    &#xD;
    &#xD;
    &#xD;
    The overarching impact of BU's practice development process is a change&#xD;
      in culture, leadership&#xD;
      and team creation. There is an extensive list of NHS and social care unit&#xD;
      contacts that can&#xD;
      corroborate this, demonstrating an effective move to evidence-based&#xD;
      practice, improved&#xD;
      communication between staff and service users and consistently improved&#xD;
      inter-agency working.&#xD;
      These include the following testimonials:&#xD;
    "Developments through practice development include pioneering work in&#xD;
      helping young people&#xD;
      with chronic conditions make the difficult transition from children's to&#xD;
      adult services; making&#xD;
      improvements to cleanliness; working with the public and patients to&#xD;
      revise visiting times and&#xD;
      protect patient privacy and dignity; introducing matron ward rounds and&#xD;
      reducing waiting times for&#xD;
      echo-cardiograms." Cardiology Department Matron &amp;#8212; Poole Hospital NHS&#xD;
        Foundation Trust&#xD;
        (R5).&#xD;
    "Implementation of a new pain pathway through practice development after&#xD;
      total knee replacement&#xD;
      led to reduced pain and 0.5 day reduction in length of stay." Orthopaedic&#xD;
        Unit Ward Manager,&#xD;
        Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (R6).&#xD;
    Organisations reap the benefits of multi-disciplinary teams and a&#xD;
      multi-agency approach, as well as&#xD;
      new leadership roles. Some further specific and measurable impacts&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
    - The North Essex NHS Foundation Trust `Patient Pathway', introduced&#xD;
      through BU's&#xD;
      practice development process in February 2010. This was achieved by&#xD;
      establishing working&#xD;
      groups who introduced training, amended recruitment criteria and&#xD;
      implemented essence of&#xD;
      care benchmarking for communication skills and continence management. One&#xD;
      year later,&#xD;
      there was an overall change in occupancy days since the pathway was&#xD;
      introduced. In one&#xD;
      ward the bed days reduced by 599 days overall, a 50 % reduction in length&#xD;
      of stay of&#xD;
      patients. This in turn reduces waiting lists and increases cost effective&#xD;
      for the NHS.&#xD;
    - The PDU at Poole Hospital NHS Foundation Trust led to streamlined&#xD;
      allergy testing in&#xD;
      2011, through the simplification of referral and appointment cancellation&#xD;
      mechanisms. This&#xD;
      resulted in appointment waiting times reduced from 13 weeks to 2 weeks.&#xD;
    Other reported benefits of practice development include a reduction in&#xD;
      pain through pain&#xD;
      management pathways, improvements to cleanliness, more patient-friendly&#xD;
      visiting times and&#xD;
      protection of patient privacy and dignity. Benefits on practice include&#xD;
      better communication&#xD;
      between staff and carers, a reduction in `inappropriate admissions', more&#xD;
      effective team&#xD;
      organisation and increased funding from service commissioners.&#xD;
    These benefits make a significant difference to treatment of patients and&#xD;
      working lives of staff in&#xD;
      Trusts serving a collective resident population of over 3.5 million. The&#xD;
      changes are also&#xD;
      contributing to a wider cultural change, which is necessary to improve&#xD;
      care. The continuing impact&#xD;
      of this research is evident through the development of PDU master classes&#xD;
      in Australia, formed&#xD;
      from the basis of BU programmes (R2).&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Bournemouth University (BU) has facilitated improvements to health and&#xD;
      social care practice&#xD;
      through cultural change in care provision. Researchers developed a&#xD;
      practice development&#xD;
      framework for implementing and assessing the delivery of evidence-based&#xD;
      practice in 82 UK health&#xD;
      and social care units during the impact period. Benefits to staff include&#xD;
      better communication and&#xD;
      team structure. Benefits to patients include higher standards of&#xD;
      cleanliness, privacy and dignity, as&#xD;
      well as a decrease in length of hospital stays and appointment waiting&#xD;
      times. Delivery has&#xD;
      extended to cover entire NHS Trusts serving a resident population of over&#xD;
      3.5 million, social&#xD;
      services departments and third sector organisations across the south of&#xD;
      England and beyond. The&#xD;
      research has since been applied to develop a similar system in Australia.&#xD;

    The term `practice development' evolved from the work of a small number&#xD;
      of nursing development&#xD;
      units (NDU's) in England during the 1990's. Those in the South of England&#xD;
      were facilitated by BU.&#xD;
      The aim, based on research by Graham (BU 1994-2007), was to reduce the&#xD;
      theory-practice gap,&#xD;
      increase use of evidence-based practice, develop a better educated&#xD;
      workforce and move away&#xD;
      from the traditional medical model towards more patient-focused care.&#xD;
    After recognition at the time that this agenda could only be achieved&#xD;
      through multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      working, there was a shift from nursing-specific development to the wider&#xD;
      concept of inter-professional&#xD;
      practice development. BU researchers Warr (BU 2011 to present), McSherry&#xD;
      (BU&#xD;
      2008-2008), Graham and Keen (BU 2004 to present), focused on practice&#xD;
      development&#xD;
      approaches that would work across a wide variety of health and social care&#xD;
      settings (P1&amp;amp;2),&#xD;
      including NHS Trusts, social services departments and other organisations.&#xD;
    The research group identified a need for teams to question and challenge&#xD;
      current practice and, by&#xD;
      using evidence, improve services. The following research themes emerged,&#xD;
      which form the basis&#xD;
      of the standards of the Practice Development Units (PDUs) BU went on to&#xD;
      establish:&#xD;
    - Practice development is intended to improve person-focused care.&#xD;
    - Practice development should be practitioner owned and should empower&#xD;
      practitioners to&#xD;
      instigate change.&#xD;
    - To be effective practice development needs to bring about cultural&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
    - Practice development improves practice through the systematic&#xD;
      introduction of evidence-&#xD;
      based care.&#xD;
    From this, they established an explicit set of standards to measure the&#xD;
      quality of units against,&#xD;
      allowing successful departments to gain PDU accreditation or status.&#xD;
      Specific information on these&#xD;
      measures and the accreditation process is detailed in the impact section&#xD;
      of this case study.&#xD;
      More recently, researchers Todres (BU 1996 to present), Galvin (BU&#xD;
      1995-2012), Holloway (BU&#xD;
      2011 to present) and Hewitt-Taylor (BU 2002 to present) have examined the&#xD;
      practice development&#xD;
      approach in a wide variety of settings, such as specialist dementia (P6)&#xD;
      and children's (P4)&#xD;
      services. The department's current research into `humanisation' theory is&#xD;
      now being integrated into&#xD;
      the process to further enhance the quality of fundamental care offered to&#xD;
      service users (Francis&#xD;
      Report 2009, 2013). Humanisation of care is based on the principle that&#xD;
      restoring humanly&#xD;
      sensitive care is about how the `humanising focus' is clearly articulated&#xD;
      and kept alive as a primary&#xD;
      focus, next to other relevant targets. This theory has emerged from&#xD;
      pioneering research and&#xD;
      philosophical work undertaken by BU (P3).&#xD;
    Practice development is a continuous process of culture change and&#xD;
      service improvement through&#xD;
      enabling teams to transform the culture and context of care (Francis&#xD;
      Report 2009, 2013). It is&#xD;
      supported by facilitators committed to a systematic, rigorous and&#xD;
      continuous process of&#xD;
      emancipatory change.&#xD;

    Novel Polymer composite building materials &amp;#8212; spin out company in the
        USA
      Dow Building Products Inc. (a,b) had a goal of inventing the leading deck
      board material, and approached us in 2004, because of our previous and
      ongoing research and facilities in solid phase orientation processing of
      polymers as well as our group's IP portfolio and track record with
      industry in this area (including Tensar geogrids, Bridon International
      Trulift elevator rope cores (b), and hot compaction technology resulting
      in CURVTM material currently exploited by Samsonite). Dow
      realized "that the development of thermoplastic composite solid state
        die drawing technology in the world was now centred in the University of
        Bradford" (a). In 2005 we started a Dow-funded project to produce a
      light weight, high-stiffness material to act as a wood replacement in
      civil engineering applications. 2005-2010 funding was &amp;#163;305k cash and
      &amp;gt;&amp;#163;350k in-kind support (materials, technical input). This support
      demonstrates the commercial value to the company of this product of our
      research, underlined by their further US investments of $2m and then $16m
      indicated below, and the significant patent portfolio now in place (a,c).
    Our research and development work took polypropylene plus 46 wt% talc,
      initial density of 1.34 g/cm3 and flexural modulus 1 GPa, to a
      similar-to-wood product target density of 800kg/m3 and 4 GPa
      modulus. Dow Building Products invested in the manufacturing technique and
      product we developed, our knowledge allowing Dow "to significantly
        accelerate its research efforts" (a). Our collaboration in setting
      up a $2m pilot line in Michigan (2008-2009) to demonstrate continuous
      processing, first demonstrated with Bridon International (b) in 2000, "contributed
        to successful scale-up" and "provided valuable trouble shooting
        capabilities" (a). The products replicate the structure of wood
      (exhibiting a fibrous nature due to oriented polypropylene) with key
      performance enhancements in weatherability, toughness, and reliability,
      and include decking, cladding, fencing, and trim.
    In 2010 Eovations LLC was formed in the USA by United Forest Products/Dow
      to further develop and commercialize `Eotek' products (a,d). This $16m
      investment created 64 jobs (13 in the research area). Our fundamental
      contribution is explicitly credited on the Eovations web site (c,e) and in
      the USA technical press (f), while the Eotek website (g) shows the
      hurricane resistance of our materials. Dow filed 3 patents with us as
      co-inventors, prior to the launch of Eovations, with 10 auxiliary patents
      filed to date (a,h). We transferred ownership of specific polymer
      orientation technology to Eovations, LLC in early 2010 (h), retaining the
      rights to develop IP for our other potential routes to exploitation, e.g.
      shape memory products for use in health care (see below) and new research
      areas in health including oriented stents and anisotropic drug elution
      products. The company has three lines in Michigan, and a new production
      plant opening in Alabama. Because of commercial confidentiality in this
      early phase of the company, they have not disclosed market share, but have
      indicated it is millions of dollars (a). Follow-on products will include
      marine, transportation, and recreation applications.
    Shape memory &amp;#8212; tissue repairs for all ages
      Die drawn shape memory polymers products based on Bradford research and
      aimed at the rapidly growing world market for both younger (sports
      injuries) and older (arthritic/ osteoporotic/ trauma-involved) patients,
      are being commercialised by Smith &amp;amp; Nephew (S&amp;amp;N), a global leader
      in medical devices (i). Estimated 2013 markets (USA and Europe) for
      shoulder fixations are 1,109,000 procedures, of value ~$856m and knee
      ligament reconstructions at 982,000 procedures, of value ~$309m. Our
      programme with S&amp;amp;N, building on our polymer orientation research,
      focussed on high performance bioresorbables (2006-2008), bone and ligament
      fixation (smart materials) (2008-2010) and design /manufacturing
      feasibility for shape memory fixations (2013). Collaboration with S&amp;amp;N
      continues, for example two joint EPSRC research proposals in 2012 each
      included support (~&amp;#163;200k contribution from the company) on manufacturing
      and biomedical materials development have been submitted.
    Shape memory polymer implants match conventional tissue fixation devices,
      with significant additional benefits as they reduce trauma to patients and
      total costs. Being smaller devices they need smaller incisions with faster
      patient recovery times, improve placement accuracy of fixations and reduce
      product inventory, as an expanding device will be able to cover a range of
      hole sizes. Our modified poly-L-lactic acids shape memory implants provide
      sufficient locking stresses, with the required profile of decay of stress
      for potential in-vivo applications, and have excellent biocompatibility.
      Smith &amp;amp; Nephew filed four patents with us in October 2012. The
      programmes with Smith &amp;amp; Nephew have been supported with &amp;#163;567k cash and
      &amp;gt;&amp;#163;200k in kind. This support demonstrates the commercial value to the
      company of this product of our research, underlined by their significant
      patent portfolio now in place (i).
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research into die drawing of polymers at Bradford has resulted in a new
      building material that is stronger and more durable than wood; and new
      bioresorbable shape-memory polymers for use in medical implants that
      reduce patient trauma and costs. The wood replacement material is
      commercialised by the United Forest Products/Dow USA 2010 spin out company
      Eovations LLC for use in a range of construction applications; the
      bioresorbable shape-memory polymers have recently been patented (4 patents
      filed) by Smith &amp;amp; Nephew for use in soft tissue fixations. These

    Led by Phil Coates (Professor 1993-present) with Bradford academics John
      Sweeney (Professor 1995-present) and Dr Phil Caton-Rose (Research
      Assistant 1998-2000, PDRA 2000-2006, Lecturer 2006-present) as part of the
      Polymer Interdisciplinary Research Centre, the team (in collaboration with
      Leeds, IM Ward FRS) has worked on bridging the gap between the science of
      solid-phase processing of polymers and advanced manufacturing technologies
      since the early 1990s. Our particular focus is on die drawing of polymer
      profiles and hot compaction of oriented polymer composite sheets. Our
      original EPSRC-funded work (1998 onwards) was developed further through
      partnerships with industry, investment by TSB and further EPSRC support
      (2011 onwards), and has established the group at Bradford as the leading
      solid-phase polymer orientation group in the world, evidenced by journal
      publications, our key, unique, research reference books (1,2), patents,
      and our industrial research contract portfolio.
    The research has developed fundamental understanding of the mechanics of
      solid-phase deformation behaviour of polymers, with new constitutive
      relationships and physical modelling used to achieve molecular-related
      understanding of deformation and feed computer modelling and control of
      structure. This has underpinned inventive steps in the design and
      implementation of batch and continuous processes to exploit the
      significant property enhancements available through solid-phase forming,
      particularly overcoming hurdles of process rates, and the novel
      exploitation of filled polymers. Die drawing (1,3,4), invented by Coates,
      involves pulling solid polymers at temperatures above their glass
      transition but below their melting point, through converging dies,
      achieving controlled oriented structures: physical properties increase
      monotonically with draw ratio (cross sectional area change imparted), and
      selected oriented polymers exhibit useful shape memory behaviour (3). It
      is applicable for all length scales (micro to macro products) and a wide
      range of polymers and cross sections, including biaxially oriented tubes.
      Initially a batch process, we first demonstrated continuous processing,
      with industry (5), and have developed fundamental modelling of orientation
      processing and deformation (6).
    Tensile drawing of filled polymers normally leads to failure.
      However, our fundamental understanding of the stress, strain and
      strain-rate fields incurred in drawing polymers through convergent dies
      (1), supported by multi length scale finite element analysis, showed that
      it was possible to control cavitation around fillers to avoid catastrophic
      failure, by simultaneously strengthening the polymer matrix through
      molecular orientation and development of crystal continuity (4). By die
      design, controlled cavitation (in a combined compressive normal stress at
      the die entry, but increasing tensile axial stress through the die)
      produces lower density products, and orientation causes higher product
      strength and stiffness, allowing continuous, high-speed production
      (~metres per minute) of controlled property products (see Dow
      exploitation).
    We developed a micro-scale version of the die drawing process for
      bioresorbable materials based on modified filled polylactic acids,
      exhibiting shape memory (through recovery of the controlled orientation),
      suitable for cementless in-body fixations (see Smith &amp;amp; Nephew
      exploitation). Die drawing to a selected draw ratio allows matching of the
      physical properties such as stiffness and strength of bone for joint or
      soft tissue repair. The challenging requirement to have shape memory
      activation at body temperatures has been addressed in our research and
      patents.
    This research has been supported commercially by BP, Solvay, Sabic, Dow,
      Smith &amp;amp; Nephew, Netlon Tensar, Bridon International, Nylacast, and
      Arterius in programmes from 1995 to date, totaling ~&amp;#163;1.25m. This work has
      resulted in 11 jointly owned patents (6 published in the last year).

    Worldwide there are some 35 million sufferers of insulin-dependent&#xD;
      diabetes. For many years, the adverse symptoms of this condition have been&#xD;
      mitigated successfully with regular injections of insulin. Initially these&#xD;
      insulins were obtained from bovine and/or porcine sources, but they did&#xD;
      not mimic well actions of endogenous insulin, leading to frequent&#xD;
      hypo-glycaemia and other complications. In 1980, the first clinical trials&#xD;
      were begun of recombinant insulins obtained by protein engineering&#xD;
      methods. From these trials it soon became apparent that the rate of&#xD;
      insulin action in vivo was a key factor in the therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of the enzyme. The best results were obtained when the insulin&#xD;
      injectate contained a mixture of fast-acting and slow-acting insulins,&#xD;
      where the latter avoids the need to have regular repeated injections and&#xD;
      minimise hypoglycemia, and the former is necessary to treat the rapid rise&#xD;
      in blood glucose levels that accompanies ingestion of food.&#xD;
    Accordingly recombinant insulin producers concentrated on controlling the&#xD;
      rate of action of insulin and its analogues. Amongst these, Novo-Nordisk&#xD;
      in collaboration with YSBL, led the way in trying to find a structural&#xD;
      rationale for the controlled disaggregation rates of hexameric insulin.&#xD;
      YSBL was the world's leading laboratory for insulin structures, and the&#xD;
      large majority of the structural work for Novo-Nordisk on insulins from&#xD;
      1993 to 2000 was done in conjunction with YSBL. The protein structures&#xD;
      published from York are available as coordinates in the Protein Data Bank.7&#xD;
      The collaboration between YSBL and Novo-Nordisk was supported by several&#xD;
      grants.8 This development programme was highly successful and&#xD;
      consequently today Novo-Nordisk is the leading developer and world's&#xD;
      largest producer of recombinant insulin for treatment of diabetes.&#xD;
    The first new product that came from York structural studies was the&#xD;
      aspartate mutant described above.1,2 This fast-acting insulin&#xD;
      was launched in 1999, marketed as NovoLog&amp;#174; in the US and&#xD;
      Insulin Novorapid&amp;#174; in Europe.9&#xD;
    The second development came from the derivatised insulins, which were&#xD;
      conceived directly from the structural work described in reference 4&#xD;
      above. It was discovered that the attachment of a fatty acid to insulin&#xD;
      led to its prolonged action, resulting in just one daily intravenous&#xD;
      administration of the hormone. These derivatised insulins received FDA&#xD;
      approval in 2005, and are marketed as the product Levemir&amp;#174; (or&#xD;
      Insulin Detemir&amp;#174;) and are now the mainstay of Novo Nordisk's&#xD;
      insulin products. Its new, improved generation insulin Degludec&amp;#174;&#xD;
      was approved by the EU and Chuikyo (Japan) in 2013.&#xD;
    Levemir&amp;#174;, NovoRapid and NovoLog&amp;#174; (also marketed as&#xD;
      Novomix&amp;#174; in a different formulation) are true blockbuster drugs&#xD;
      with billion dollar sales (reference 10). Levemir&amp;#174; had US sales&#xD;
      of $1.7 billion in 2012 growing from $756 million in 2008. The&#xD;
      corresponding figures for Novolog&amp;#174; are $1.6 billion and $1.1&#xD;
      billion, and for Novorapid, $2.7 billion and $1.5 billion. Levemir&amp;#174;&#xD;
      and Novolog&amp;#174; are currently number 40 and 42 in the ranking of&#xD;
      US drugs by sales. Total worldwide sales of the drugs were $6 billion in&#xD;
      2012 (Figure).10&#xD;

	  &#xD;
    Svend Ludvigsen (Vice-President, Diabetes formulation, biophysics and&#xD;
      structure) at Novo Nordisk assesses the impact of York's work as follows:11&#xD;
    "Throughout the years the collaboration with York has been a continuous&#xD;
      source of inspiration for the understanding of insulin structure and&#xD;
      insulin as pharmaceutical products. The work of Whittingham et al. 1997&#xD;
      has provided significant insight into some of the protraction principles&#xD;
      of the insulin analog, insulin Detemir, developed into a once daily basal&#xD;
      insulin product Levemir&amp;#174;. Novorapid&amp;#174; (US: Novolog&amp;#174;) and Levemir&amp;#174; both have&#xD;
      blockbuster status and are used by millions of patients all around the&#xD;
      globe."&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Insulin derivatives that stem directly from structural work carried out&#xD;
      within the York Structural Biology Laboratory (YSBL) are now the standard&#xD;
      treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes for some 35 million patients&#xD;
      worldwide. The successful development of new insulin drugs hinged upon&#xD;
      controlling their speed of action following intravenous administration.&#xD;
      This speed of action is controlled by insulin's degree of aggregation,&#xD;
      which, in turn, is determined by protein-protein interactions.&#xD;
      Understanding, modifying and controlling these interactions depended on&#xD;
      detailed structural studies of insulin, insulin mutants and insulin&#xD;
      derivatives. The most widely used derivatives were developed following&#xD;
      structural work carried out within YSBL in the Department of Chemistry.&#xD;
      The research has had economic impact through sales of the insulin drugs&#xD;
      (over $6 billion in 2012) and major health impacts on diabetics worldwide.&#xD;

    Background to research. The late GG Dodson FRS played a major role&#xD;
      in the initial determination and analysis of the structure of insulin by&#xD;
      X-ray crystallography in the Oxford laboratory of Nobel laureate DC&#xD;
      Hodgkin. The insulin project moved to York when Hodgkin retired, and over&#xD;
      the next twenty years many further structures of native insulin, insulin&#xD;
      mutants and insulin derivatives were determined. These structures allowed&#xD;
      both academic and industrial scientists to understand how the structure of&#xD;
      insulin relates to its biological activity, and how the physico-chemical&#xD;
      properties of different preparations of insulin can be engineered to&#xD;
      provide therapeutic options.&#xD;
    Naturally occurring insulin is stored in the pancreas in crystals, made&#xD;
      up of three insulin dimers coordinated by zinc ions. They dissociate into&#xD;
      active insulin monomer upon release into the blood stream. A basal level&#xD;
      of insulin (pM) is maintained in the blood stream and increases in&#xD;
      response to increased glucose in the blood following a meal. The original&#xD;
      therapy for Type I diabetics was injection of insulin crystals extracted&#xD;
      from pig or cow pancreas. However, it did not reproduce the physiological&#xD;
      blood levels of insulin and caused immune responses to foreign hormones.&#xD;
      All these led to the long-term complications associated with insulin&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
    From 1984 to 2000, YSBL engaged in a major collaboration on recombinant,&#xD;
      novel modified insulins with Novo Nordisk A/S (www.novonordisk.com).
      The structures of these analogues provided a detailed understanding of the&#xD;
      nature of insulin aggregation. The focus of the work in 1993 moved towards&#xD;
      the rational design of modified insulins in order to obtain clinically&#xD;
      applicable monomeric insulins &amp;#8212; they are now the basis of the modern&#xD;
      "fast-acting" insulins. Furthermore, structures of insulin crystals with&#xD;
      various additives and/or modifications identified some general principles&#xD;
      on how to increase stability of insulin hexamers, leading to the current&#xD;
      "long-lasting" insulin preparations.&#xD;
    Research during period. The key breakthroughs during the&#xD;
      assessment period were carried out by J. L Whittingham and R. E. Hubbard&#xD;
      with G. G. Dodson:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      
Design of rapid-acting monomeric insulins: The crystal&#xD;
        structure of insulin hexamers and dimers suggested amino acid mutations,&#xD;
        which would lead to a monomeric insulin. The structures of such proteins&#xD;
        are reported in references 1 (1993) and 2 (1998). In one of these&#xD;
        proteins, B28 proline is mutated to aspartic acid; this is the insulin&#xD;
        of the Novo Nordisk product Insulin aspart.&amp;#174;
&#xD;
      
Identifying additives to stabilise insulin preparations:&#xD;
        References 2 (1998) and 3 (1995) describe structures of series of&#xD;
        preparations in which hexamer formation is stabilised. The structure of&#xD;
        a m-cresol-insulin clathrate led to the proposal that mutation&#xD;
        to tryptophan at the end of the B chain would disrupt the insulin&#xD;
        aggregate. This mutant was found to have improved stability in Novo&#xD;
        Nordisk's very complex protein manufacturing processes.&#xD;
      
Modifications to generate long-active insulins: References 4&#xD;
        (1997) and 5 (2004) report the crystal structures of acylated insulins&#xD;
        which had been identified by Novo Nordisk as prolonged-acting insulins.&#xD;
        The YSBL research suggested that the prolonged action was more likely to&#xD;
        be related to the way that these modified insulins aggregated in&#xD;
        solution (and in the crystals). These soluble prolonged-acting insulins&#xD;
        are significantly better for diabetics than other long-acting insulins.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Insulin research in York continues. Throughout the 2000s AM Brzozowski of&#xD;
      YSBL worked with an international team on the development of super-active&#xD;
      analogues of insulin. These have provided the tools that enabled a&#xD;
      breakthrough in 2013 (reference 6) in the determination of the structure&#xD;
      of the first insulin receptor-insulin complex. Insights from this work&#xD;
      will have an impact in the future on the design of further insulin&#xD;
      analogues with the prospect of oral delivery of insulin.&#xD;

    The impact of the York Model of Exchange Bias has been significant in
      that every magnetic
      recording read head in the world is now designed based on the underpinning
      physical insight that
      was developed. In 2011 alone this involved about one billion components,
      400 million of which
      were manufactured by Seagate Technology in Northern Ireland. The total
      revenue from these
      products is approximately $6 billion based on an output of 2.5 million
      heads/day each with a unit
      value of circa $6. Following a series of mergers Seagate and Western
      Digital now command over
      90% of the world-wide hard drive industry with a turnover of $34 billion
      per annum. . In a letter of
      support from Dr Mahendra Pakela (former Director Western Digital Fremont)
      to Professor O'Grady,
      the commercial value of this impact is confirmed: "I am happy to confirm
      that your work, which is
      now broadly accepted as the correct interpretation of exchange bias in
      granular antiferromagnetic
      layers, has enabled my company to design and develop improved layers which
      we incorporate in
      all the read heads we currently manufacture. This amounts to hundreds of
      millions of components
      each year." Using the work it was possible to design an antiferromagnetic
      layer in terms of its
      crystal orientation, grain size, size distribution and layer thickness,
      tailored to the
      equipment/process used to achieve exchange bias. This in turn allowed for
      the development of
      layers with up to two times greater alignment and thermal stability. In
      consequence thinner layers
      could be used for increasing resolution.
    The close relationship between O'Grady's group and the major magnetic
      recording companies
      ensured that the work was disseminated, not only via publications, but via
      regular visits to the three
      major hard drive manufacturers, i.e. Seagate, Western Digital and Hitachi
      GST. Hitachi GST and
      Western Digital are in the process of merging which means that all hard
      drive manufacturers are
      involved in utilising this work. Additionally Seagate Northern Ireland,
      have sponsored students in
      O'Grady's group continuously for the last six years and Seagate Media
      Research in Fremont
      sponsored students prior to that. Subsequently Western Digital provided
      financial support for
      contract measurements which supported post docs in York and Seagate
      Technology, Northern
      Ireland, are now doing the same. Further support for another PhD student
      for 3 years has been
      secured from Seagate from January 2012. A further contract with Seagate
      with a value of $400K
      has been secured which includes 50% support for a new lectureship (taken
      up Vallejo-Fernandez).
    All the major manufacturers of read heads in the world have modified both
      the growth processes
      for antiferromagnetic layers and their setting processes based on the new
      physical insights into
      exchange bias that we developed.
    All work associated with the development of the York Model of Exchange
      Bias was undertaken
      here in York. The York Model has now displaced all other models of
      exchange bias based on
      computer simulations of complex AF domain structures. Working in
      collaboration with Western
      Digital in 2009, an increase in the maximum reported value of exchange
      bias of more than a factor
      2 to 3.6 kOe was reported. This system was designed using the York Model
      and remains the
      world record value [4].
    The new insight into exchange bias materials that has been established
      has improved the thermal
      stability of the AF layers in certain designs of read heads by up to a
      factor 2. The new
      understanding has also enabled AF materials to be designed for purpose.
      For example, for
      perpendicular recording the overall thickness of the read head stack
      determines the linear data
      density along the track. In collaboration with Seagate in Northern
      Ireland, studies have been
      undertaken that allowed for the stack thickness to be reduced from 12nm to
      6nm for certain
      applications. This allows for a potential doubling of the linear density
      along track although in
      practice the increased resolution was used to improve signal to noise.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    A new procedure for the measurement and characterisation of
      polycrystalline exchange bias
      systems has been developed which has impacted significantly the
      manufacture of computer hard
      drive read-heads by companies such as Seagate Inc and Western Digital
      Corp. The new
      measurement procedure has enabled a typical 40% increase in the thermal
      stability of the
      antiferromagnetic materials used in computer hard drive read heads. The
      procedure has also
      improved the manufacturing process of the read-heads giving increased
      material performance and
      has resulted in a ~25% improvement in the resolution of detecting a bit.

    Since 1996 read heads based on the Giant Magneto Resistive effect have
      used exchange bias
      technology. Exchange bias systems are a ferromagnetic (F) film grown on an
      antiferromagnetic
      (AF) film pinning the magnetic orientation of the ferromagnet. Control of
      the behaviour of an
      antiferromagnetic material used in exchange bias systems is vital. Thin
      film antiferromagnetic
      materials do not give a measureable signal related to their degree of
      order and thermal stability by
      any direct technique making the study of these properties difficult.
    Prof O'Grady and Dr Vallejo-Fernandez who at the time was a PhD student
      funded by an EU
      Training Network known as NEXBIAS, have developed a new measurement
      protocol which allows
      the thermal stability within AF layers to be determined. These layers
      consist of polycrystalline
      grains with sizes 5-15 nm produced by sputtering. To initiate the exchange
      bias effect the sample
      is heated and field cooled with the F layer saturated in one direction.
      Reversing the direction of the
      F layer then reverses the direction of the exchange field on the AF and
      allows for thermal activation
      to be used progressively to alter the orientation of the AF grains. The
      measurement protocols
      developed at York based on this concept enables the so-called distribution
      of blocking
      temperatures of the AF grains to be determined. Such exchange bias
      characterisation takes 15
      hours per sample for a statistically significant measurement.
    Using the developed exchange bias characterisation procedure, it was
      found that the thermal
      stability of the AF materials is a grain volume dependent effect. The
      measurement of a grain
      volume distribution is challenging. Typically 800 grains are required to
      characterise the median
      volume and the standard deviation. It was shown that the initial alignment
      process used by
      manufacturers was incomplete and a significant fraction of the grains were
      not stable at room
      temperature. The exchange bias effect is proportional to the integral over
      the volume distribution.
      The developed analysis procedure produced a remarkable fit to experimental
      data for the film
      thickness and the grain size within a series of films. It was possible to
      predict the rate of alignment
      of AF grains during the setting process. This has an impact on the design
      of the setting
      procedures used in manufacturing. The grain size work, whilst not
      undertaken in collaboration with
      industry, was rapidly adopted first by Western Digital Corporation and
      subsequently by Seagate
      Technology. These two companies manufacture 90% of the world's read heads
      with a value of
      ~$10Billion. Dr A Johnson (Vice President, Transducer Development, Seagate
      Technology,
      Northern Ireland in a letter of support states: "(this work)...constituted
      the only known mechanism
      for assessing the degree of order and thermal stability of
      antiferromagnetic grains."
    The exchange bias work has shown that the interfaces between the layers
      consist of spin clusters
      whose alignment can occur spontaneously at low temperatures, be increased
      by high setting fields
      and behave independently of the AF grains. Subsequently O'Grady reported
      on factors which
      control the anisotropy of the AF grains including texture, composition and
      impurities. The model
      has been extended to explain exchange bias in single crystal and large
      grain systems based on a
      strong domain wall pinning concept. A patent for a new design for advanced
      solid state magnetic
      memory has been filed and is being developed in collaboration with Hitachi
      Europe Ltd.

    The CASTEP material modelling software developed by York academic Dr Matt
      Probert and colleagues is a commercial software package to undertake
      density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical simulations. CASTEP is
      marketed by Accelrys Inc and used by over 830 different companies
      (including Boeing, Johnson Matthey, Dupont, Toyota, General Motors and
      Unilever) and has generated over $30m sales since 2002. Accelrys is a
      leading scientific research and development software and service company,
      and is based in San Diego with European headquarters in Cambridge. It has
      an established position in the field of materials modelling and simulation
      currently based around the Materials Studio application, which includes
      CASTEP as a separately licensed component.
    One customer is the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota, which has used the
      CASTEP code for a number of projects, which can be evidenced by a number
      of patent applications. They use CASTEP to predict the properties of any
      material using the power of quantum mechanics, and also to support
      experimental studies of materials and processes by helping with the
      interpretation of experiments, offering a unique `atom by atom'
      perspective on what is happening. As an example, Toyota used CASTEP to
      develop new ceramic catalysts for exhaust gas purification [i]. The same
      car manufacturer has now used CASTEP to design improved lithium-hydride
      batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles [ii]. The development of
      efficient energy-storage batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles forms
      a major part of the international response to global warming and the move
      away from oil as an energy source. Many companies worldwide have used
      CASTEP to develop new battery materials over a number of years as part of
      this effort.
    A different energy-based commercial application of CASTEP is the
      screening of potential fuel cell materials by Johnson Matthey [iii]. Fuel
      cells could play a key role in a future "hydrogen economy" replacing the
      internal combustion engine as the power source in vehicles. The key idea
      is to carry hydrogen as a fuel, and in the fuel cell to combine this with
      oxygen from the air, to generate energy (electricity) and have water as
      the only waste product. A related topic is the green generation of
      hydrogen to power these fuel cells, for which CASTEP has also been used
      (ref 4 above).
    A different commercial application using CASTEP is work by Sony to
      develop light-weight flexible computer screen displays [iv] which was
      reported at an Accelrys User Group conference.
    CASTEP is widely used within many materials-based industries &amp;#8212; see http://accelrys.com/products/materials-studio/modules/CASTEP.html
      for a commercial overview. This can also be seen in the wide range of
      companies that cite CASTEP in their patent applications &amp;#8212; over 100 patent
      applications by 2013 - of which over 50 have already been granted. These
      include companies such as Semiconducting Energy Lab Co, Canon, Fuji,
      Institut Francais du P&amp;#233;trole, Toyota, etc. Of these, 75 have been filed
      since 2008.
    The $30m sales figures are confirmed in a letter-of-support received in
      November 2012 from Accelrys. A commercial-in-confidence presentation to
      the CDG revealed a more detailed breakdown of the sales figures by sector
      (64% of sales to commercial organisations and 8% to Government
      organisations with the remainder purchased by academic users). Within the
      commercial organisations the largest customer group is the automotive
      industry, followed by the electronics industry. Ted Pawela, Senior
      Director of Materials Science Product Marketing wrote "The quantum
        mechanics expertise and software provided to us by the CASTEP Developers
        Group enable us to provide more complete and valuable software solutions
        to our customers. Globally, we now have 830 unique customers who use
        this software, including such marquis companies as The Boeing Company,
        Johnson Matthey, Dupont, Toyota, General Motors, and Unilever. Sales
        revenue for the CASTEP software now exceeds $30,000,000. These
        statistics provide clear evidence of the importance of CASTEP to
        materials related product innovation, ...."
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    A computer program, CASTEP, has been developed to use quantum mechanics
      to calculate the structure and properties of materials. The code is
      distributed commercially via Accelrys Inc. with sales, for example, in the
      automotive, electronics and pharmaceutical industries in excess of &amp;#163;1m per
      year since 1998, accelerating to over &amp;#163;2.5m per year recently and total
      sales (late 2012) exceeding $30m. Commercial applications include
      designing new battery materials and electrodes to improve the performance
      of electric cars (Toyota), integrating organic electronic materials for
      light-weight flexible displays (Sony), and developing new catalysts for
      hydrogen-powered fuel cells (Johnson-Matthey).

    Materials modelling using ab-initio electronic structure calculations
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Physics</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    CASTEP is a robust and accurate, general-purpose materials modelling code
      built upon the Density Functional Theory (DFT) version of quantum
      mechanics. DFT was conceived in the 1960s, though the theoretical
      framework is still being actively developed, with important recent
      contributions by academic staff at York (Professor Rex Godby and Dr Matt
      Probert). The seminal CASTEP paper was published in 2002 [1] and Dr
      Probert and Dr Phil Hasnip from Physics, York are co-authors describing
      the development of the code.
    CASTEP can be used to predict the properties of any material using the
      power of quantum mechanics, and also to support experimental studies of
      materials and processes by helping with the interpretation of experiments,
      offering a unique `atom by atom' perspective. Sample published results
      using the code for commercially important developments have been reported
      in the open literature [2 - 3], but much industrial work is
      commercial-in-confidence.
    The underlying research and development of CASTEP began in 1999 with a
      core team of UK academics &amp;#8212; the CASTEP Developers Group (CDG) &amp;#8212; and
      continues to date. Probert and Hasnip are founding members of the CDG.
      Probert joined the York Physics Department in 2000 and leads the York
      contribution, which is responsible for the calculation of the groundstate
      wavefunction, molecular dynamics and structure optimisation. Hasnip moved
      to York in 2005 and works for Probert as a PDRA. The first complete
      version of CASTEP was released in 2002, and there have been new releases
      annually since then, with each new release incorporating new science
      capabilities and calculation speed increases. The functionality developed
      at York is fundamental to every CASTEP-based study.
    The CDG currently comprises six academics: Probert (York), Hasnip (York),
      Clark (Durham), Pickard (UCL), Refson (STFC), Yates (Oxford) and their
      associated research groups. Each member of the core team is responsible
      for writing and developing specific areas of functionality: Hasnip's
      primary area is the calculation of the groundstate wavefunction, and
      Probert's is molecular dynamics and structure optimisation.
    In total, the York contribution to CASTEP amounts to more than 1/3 of the
      core of the code (both in terms of Probert and Hasnip having written more
      than 1/3 of the `lines of code' and in terms of core functionality)
      providing key features that are needed by all users of the code. This core
      functionality includes finding the ground state energy and wavefunction of
      the system, and then using this to find the most stable arrangement of the
      atoms within the material. This is the essential first step in any
      CASTEP-based study. The core CASTEP functionality is summarised in ref
      [5]. The York contribution underpins the more advanced functionality, such
      as the calculation of the electronic band structure (using concepts
      developed at York), the phonon dispersion, and many experimentally
      important spectra such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Electron
      Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Electron Energy Loss Spectoscopy (EELS), and
      Raman spectroscopy.
    The York team have also developed new algorithms (along with rigorous
      theoretical proofs of correctness) that have been implemented to add extra
      functionality to CASTEP. Examples include Langevin NPT molecular dynamics
      [6] and a real-space genetic algorithm for crystal structure prediction
      [7]. This functionality is used to simulate the finite temperature
      properties of the material (Langevin NPT) and in finding new catalyst
      structures using a genetic algorithm. Recently, Hasnip has developed a
      novel approach to electronic energy minimization which is faster and more
      robust, based upon mapping the charge density to an equivalent bosonic
      system (paper under peer-review).
    Probert has supervised five postgraduate research students and two PDRAs
      since 2000 all of whom have contributed to the development of CASTEP,
      either as collaborators in the development of new functionality and/or as
      users of the code. Most of the functionality developed has been
      incorporated into the commercially available code, whilst the remainder is
      available for independent download as an add-on via the group website (http://www.cmt.york.ac.uk/cmd )
      or the CASTEP website ( http://www.castep.org).
    Through internal funding and by application to UK research council
      funding, three successive Beowulf computer clusters have been installed at
      York over the period 2002 - 12. These provided local high level computing
      facilities enabling testing of code relevant to the development of the
      CASTEP code, particularly the optimisation of parallelisation procedures.
    Collaboration between the research groups of Godby and Probert and input
      from an EU network on theoretical spectroscopy co-ordinated by Godby has
      provided further impetus to CASTEP development. There have also been a
      number of developments by the CDG in supporting industrial and other users
      of the CASTEP code, such as the establishment of a community mailing list
      and forum, web sites, and a number of training workshops attended by York
      staff (most recently in Oxford (2013, 2009), Frankfurt (2012) and Delhi
      (2011)).

    In 1997 Professor El-Gomati formed York Probes Sources Ltd (YPS Ltd) to
      exploit his expertise to collaborate with commercial companies to develop
      new SEM devices, pushing them beyond their conventional limits. YPS won a
      SMART award (1997) to develop novel field emitters that incorporated an
      electron cathode with other electrodes in a single unit to be used in
      miniaturised and conventional SEMs based on El-Gomati's research at York.
      Today, this company employs five members of staff and averages an annual
      turn-over of about &amp;#163;300k. El-Gomati's research group have worked with some
      of the largest surface science and microscopy companies including
      Shimadzu, Cameca, FEI Inc., Novelx (Agilent) and Carl Zeiss.
      The group has delivered impact in three main areas, as follows:
    Miniaturisation of Field Emission Technologies.
    The research lead to the development by York Probe Sources Ltd of
      small-sized electron columns and a novel Field Emission source/cathode
      (operating at &amp;lt;1000V and delivering current intensity ~
      50-100f06dmA/str). A US-based start-up, Novelx Inc. successfully trialled
      and used the source to realise the first and still the only commercially
      available desktop, field emission Scanning Electron Microscope (2008),
      approximately the same size as a laser printer. Their desktop SEM product,
      MySEM, won the USA Prestigious R&amp;amp;D 100 Award for Innovative
      Scanning Electron Microscope (2009). MySEM is now in use in
      several top US academic and research laboratories including MIT, Berkeley
      and the Naval Research Labs for research into nanotechnology, MEMS and
      polymers as well as process development, verification and failure analysis
      in laboratories.
    In 2010, Agilent Technologies acquired Novelx for an undisclosed sum [2].
      The desktop SEM (8500 FE-SEM [3, 4) retails for [text removed for
        publication] (less than half the price of a conventional SEM),
      bringing it within reach of a far wider market. Furthermore, it occupies a
      footprint of less than 3 cubic feet; significantly smaller than
      conventional room-sized SEMs, again allowing it to be used in a wider
      range of applications and locations such as clean rooms and confined
      areas. Since the Agilent acquisition, it is estimated that more than [text
        removed for publication] have been sold world-wide [1]. Lawrence
      Murray, Director of R&amp;amp;D at FESEM for Agilent Technologies says "This
      product particularly stands out from others in this market because it
      provides customers the only desktop tool with enough resolution and
      surface fidelity to image features at nanoscale dimensions." and "Without
      the novel TFE work of Professor El-Gomati ... this type of tool would not
      have been possible." [1]
    High angular intensity Schottky electron source.
    As a result of the collaboration with Shimadzu they have, to date,
      invested [text removed for publication] in the evaluation and
      refinement of the new cathode. The work has now been transferred to their
      Business Production Division, and they are making significant investment
      through a team of a dozen engineers with the aim of launching "the most
      powerful electron beam instrument to the world" [8].
    LaB6 in `Virtual Source Mode'
    Together with project partner, Carl Zeiss (UK), a conventional thermionic
      electron cathode, using a lanthanum hexaboride crystal (LaB6)
      as the electron source, was configured to be used in the virtual source
      mode [5]. This configuration provides three benefits in comparison to
      operation in the thermionic mode 1) a smaller source size by a factor of
      more than 10 times, 2) a reduced initial energy spread of the emitted
      electrons by approximately 3-4 times and 3) increased source brightness of
      approximately 10 times on its value when operated in the conventional
      mode. These factors lead to a smaller beam size for a given beam current
      and allow one to use a lower beam voltage than previously necessary.
    The advantages of these features are that they allow users of this
      instrument to investigate radiation sensitive and insulating materials at
      much higher resolution than previously possible. In addition, operating
      this class of cathodes in the virtual source mode, whilst similar to a
      field emitter, does not require altering the shape of the commercially
      available cathode to produce a sharp needle as is required for the more
      expensive field emitters. Further, the vacuum requirements of the LaB6
      electron cathode in this mode are only high vacuum which is much simpler
      and less expensive to achieve than UHV.
    This virtual source mode of operation was used by Carl Zeiss SMT
      (Cambridge, UK) in developing a new and unprecedented generation of SEM &amp;#8212;
      the `EVO HD' ([6],[7],[8]) launched in 2011. This instrument, which is
      less expensive (approx. half the price) than an FE-SEM, has high imaging
      capabilities at lower beam energies (&amp;lt;2keV) &amp;#8212; an essential feature,
      especially for radiation sensitive materials, such as biological and
      medical materials, novel photoresists, nanotubes and nanorods. Dr. S.
      Beam, Physics manager at Zeiss said [5]: "This instrument has the best
      performance of any conventional scanning electron microscope whilst
      maintaining a price that is both acceptable for a conventional microscope
      and lower than any high performance, field emission based, microscope.
      EVO&amp;#174; HD instruments have been sold within Europe, North America and the UK
      with other regions expected to follow in due course."
    Low Voltage Microscopy
    The semiconductor industry remains the single largest beneficiary of the
      advances and developments made in electron microscopy. SEMs occupy a key
      role in quality control assessment, where for example Critical Dimension
      SEMs (or CD-SEMs) are a major tool for critical dimension measurement, as
      well as for defect review analysis.
    Research in this low voltage microscopy mode, has led to a better
      understanding of the signals obtained from the SEM. The understanding
      coming from this research underpins the growing use of low voltage SEM
      with its superior surface contrast, thus allowing nanoscale features to be
      observed on a wide variety of nanostructured materials, including
      polymers, thin films, biomaterials, and other energy-sensitive samples on
      any substrate, even glass. For example, using low voltage SEMs (&amp;lt;5keV),
      it is now possible to differentiate between differently doped
      semiconductors (i.e. p- and n-types; the fundamental building blocks in
      semiconductor devices).
    Low and variable voltage operation of the SEM also negates the
      requirement for coating insulating materials that would charge up under a
      given electron beam energy, leading to both efficiency savings (as the
      materials do not need to be coated) and the removal of interference from
      the coatings in the images themselves.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Since the 1950s, when they were first developed, scanning electron
      microscopes (SEMs) have revolutionised science. However, the large
      physical size of these machines and their aggressive treatment of samples
      has limited their use. Now research carried out by Professor Mohamed
      El-Gomati has led to the development of products for global companies
      including Agilent, Carl Zeiss and Shimadzu. These products include the
      world's first low-voltage desktop SEM, capable of resolving features
      smaller than 5 nanometres, and handling radiation sensitive samples such
      as biological and medical materials, novel photoresists, nanotubes and
      nanorods. The smaller size has also improved accessibility of such
      instruments leading to significant efficiency gains for companies and
      academia worldwide.

    Conventional SEMs are large in physical size and often require their own
      room, along with dedicated operator and facilities. Having to rely on a
      centralised SEM for imaging hampers the innovation process and can delay
      the time to market. Researchers and developers are forced to plan their
      research and product development programs around the limited availability
      of a centralised SEM. Furthermore, conventional SEMs are limited to solid,
      inorganic samples small enough to fit inside the vacuum chamber that can
      handle moderate vacuum pressure.
    In order to overcome some of these limitations, Professor El-Gomati and
      his team from the Department of Electronics at the University of York,
      have been developing and carrying out research on the electron source for
      electron microscopy. There are two electron source types used in electron
      microscopes: thermionic and field emission. Thermionic sources only
      require high vacuum for their operation but suffer from a large source
      size (&amp;gt;10f06dm), short lifetime (~ 100s hrs), emit electrons with a
      spread in their initial energies (&amp;gt;1.5eV), and added together cause
      large final beam sizes, which are not suitable to resolve nanostructures.
      Field emission sources have smaller source size (~30nm), a small energy
      spread (&amp;lt;0.6eV), a longer life time (&amp;gt;10,000hrs) and are therefore
      becoming increasingly popular &amp;#8212; especially for nano-scale technologies.
      However, conventional field emission sources are limited in voltage used
      (3,000-5,000V) and the corresponding current density (300-500f06dA/str).
      Whilst this suited the existing microscope technology, operating outside
      these parameters to suit new developments proved inaccessible, leading to
      beam current instability (for low current density operation) or the
      source's total destruction, when operated for high current applications.
      The York team have improved the electron source in three major ways and
      has helped improve the understanding of low energy SEM imaging.
    Miniaturisation of field emission technologies. This
      research in electron optics and field emission cathodes has led to the
      development of several small-sized electron columns, some measure &amp;lt;10cm
      in height, typically 10 times smaller than conventional column sizes. This
      development, which is based on using electrostatic electrodes instead of
      the normally used magnetic coils that require water cooling, is vitally
      important in reducing the size of SEMs. In addition, SEM miniaturisation
      requires low voltage cathodes, and this trend of miniaturisation led to
      the development of an integrated cathode-extractor electrode as part of a
      pre-aligned column [1, 2].
    High angular intensity Schottky electron source. Operating
      conventional Schottky emitters beyond 0.5mA/str leads to their
      destruction, which has limited their use in high current applications.
      El-Gomati and his group have been researching alternative source
      configurations where the electron optical characteristics of the electron
      gun part are (focal properties) taken into consideration when realising
      the electron emitter. In collaboration with Shimadzu Corp. of Japan,
      El-Gomati and co-workers have developed a new Schottky emitter capable of
      operating well beyond 1mA/str. [3]
    Operating a LaB6 cathode in `Virtual
          source Mode' Operating ultra-high vacuum (UHV), as is required
      for field emitters, is both expensive and time consuming. Lanthanum
      hexaboride (LaB6) electron guns depend on thermionic emission
      of electrons from a heated LaB6 crystal, which are ~10x
      brighter than tungsten and have significantly longer lifetimes, but
      require higher vacuum levels, often increasing the SEM's cost. The
      emitting area of LaB6 is large thus reducing its brightness and
      consequently its beam current capability. El-Gomati and co-workers
      demonstrated in 2010 [3] the advantages of operating the LaB6
      cathode in the field emission mode. In doing so, they were able to exploit
      smaller energy spread and source size than in the thermionic mode, which
      led to a higher brightness source that is essential for high resolution
      microscopy [4].
    Low Voltage Microscopy Research in low voltage microscopy
      mode, led to a better understanding of the signals obtained from the SEM.
      A new model describing the mechanism of image contrast was proposed in
      2001 [5] and a set of guiding rules to assist users was published in 2005
      [6]. Further research in low voltage SEM led to a systematic study of
      backscattered and secondary electron emission signals forming SEM images.
      El-Gomati's research led to an overhaul of the accepted theory (60 years
      old), explaining secondary electron emission (Cosslett award, MSA, USA;
      2008).
    This research was carried out at the University of York, led by Professor
      El-Gomati (at York as Professor since 1998). Others involved in this
      research at York are: Roberts, Kudjoe, Bakush, and Zaggout (PhD students)
      and Prutton,Tear, and Wilson (Research Associates).

    The overall beneficiary of Southampton's underpinning research on&#xD;
      photonic quasi-crystals and their applications has been Luxtaltek&#xD;
      Corporation [5.1], a leading global manufacturer of photonic crystal LED&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
    The process of Research leading to Impact&#xD;
    As a direct result of the Southampton research, spinout company&#xD;
      Mesophotonics Ltd. successfully developed a range of products that&#xD;
      incorporated photonic crystals into LEDs. These products offered an&#xD;
      increased brightness of ~15% on other LEDs, which gave them a significant&#xD;
      competitive advantage. In April 2008, this arm of Mesophotonics' business&#xD;
      and the company's photonic crystal intellectual property (IP) were&#xD;
      acquired by Luxtaltek Corporation, a Taiwanese LED manufacturer [5.2].&#xD;
    Economic Impact&#xD;
    Following its acquisition of the Mesophotonics IP, Luxtaltek announced it&#xD;
      would shift its focus to manufacturing high-brightness LEDs using the&#xD;
      photonic crystal IP to increase the production and brightness of its LED&#xD;
      chips. This is a clear indication of economic impact where a business&#xD;
        has adopted a new technology through acquisition of IP that came&#xD;
      from research on photonic crystals for improving the efficiency of optical&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
    Luxtaltek expanded the manufacturing capacity of its Chuan Factory with&#xD;
      new chip fabrication facilities [5.3] indicating the improvement of&#xD;
        the performance of the business through introduction of new,&#xD;
      photonic crystal LEDs, products.&#xD;
    To acquire and support this new activity Luxtaltek invested approximately&#xD;
      &amp;#163;10m. Consultancy to lead Luxtaltek's research, development and&#xD;
      implementation of photonics-crystals in LED epitaxy is provided by Dr&#xD;
      Martin Charlton. The involvement of Dr Martin Charlton indicates that&#xD;
      a new technology was adopted through provision of consultancy that drew&#xD;
      on his research.&#xD;
    Evidence of economic impact&#xD;
    LuxtalTek now manufactures and supplies LED chips and crystalline grains,&#xD;
      used in digital displays, traffic signs, household electrical appliance&#xD;
      and automobile products all over the world [5.4]. In 2009 UniLite reported&#xD;
      Luxtaltek's monthly production capacity of 550m blue LED chips and 1.5&#xD;
      billion LED chips for outdoor-display use. In the period 2008-2012,&#xD;
      Luxtaltek made total profits of &amp;#163;35 million on LEDs with photonic&#xD;
      quasi-crystals [5.5]. Luxtaltek is currently employing more than 300&#xD;
      people in its photonic crystal LEDs production facilities [5.6].&#xD;
    Impact on the environment&#xD;
    By influencing the business strategy of one of the world's LED&#xD;
      manufacturers, the research has also contributed to an international move&#xD;
      towards more energy efficient lighting. LEDs hold multiple advantages over&#xD;
      incandescent energy sources, notably lower energy consumption, smaller&#xD;
      size and longer lifetimes, and are widely used in high-efficiency lighting&#xD;
      applications. The US Department of Energy advocates the use of LEDs. It&#xD;
      says on its website: "Widespread use of LED lighting has the greatest&#xD;
      potential impact on energy savings in the United States. By 2027,&#xD;
      widespread use of LEDs could save 348TWh ... of electricity: this is the&#xD;
      equivalent of the annual electrical output of 44 large electric power&#xD;
      plants (1000 megawatts each) and a total savings of more than US$30&#xD;
      billion at today's electricity prices." [5.7]&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Implementation of photonic quasi-crystals on light emitting diodes (LEDs)&#xD;
      can produce more light using less energy. This technology was brought to&#xD;
      the global market via the successful commercialisation of laboratory&#xD;
      devices derived from research in nanophotonics and the subsequent&#xD;
      development of photonic quasi-crystals by a multi-disciplinary team from&#xD;
      the University of Southampton. The intellectual property of the technology&#xD;
      was acquired and adopted in 2008 by Luxtaltek Corporation, a global&#xD;
      manufacturer of LEDs. In the period 2008-2012 Luxtaltek Corporation, made&#xD;
      total profits of &amp;#163;35 million utilising the photonic quasi-crystal LED&#xD;
      technology, employing more than 300 people in its production facilities.&#xD;

    LEDs are one of the most energy-efficient lighting technologies today.&#xD;
      They consume less energy, last longer, are smaller, more durable and offer&#xD;
      comparable or better light quality than other incandescent energy sources.&#xD;
      Seminal research conducted at the University of Southampton focused on the&#xD;
      application of photonic quasi-crystals on light emitting diodes and was&#xD;
      published in 2000 [3.1]. Led by Professors Jeremy Baumberg (1998&#xD;
      to 2007) in the School of Physics and Astronomy, and Greg Parker&#xD;
      (1987-2010) in the School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS), this&#xD;
      research set out to harness the capabilities of photonic crystals &amp;#8212;&#xD;
      periodic optical nanostructures designed to control and manipulate light &amp;#8212;&#xD;
      to create technologies to improve the light efficiency of LEDs and&#xD;
      generate white light supercontinuum. Between 1996 and 2004 this research&#xD;
      was supported by two successive EPSRC grants [3.5, 3.6]. A typical&#xD;
      semiconductor material used in the production of LEDs has a high&#xD;
      refractive index, limiting the amount of light that can be extracted. The&#xD;
      research into photonic quasi-crystals led to their incorporation into&#xD;
      energy-efficient LEDs, aimed to increase light extraction and therefore&#xD;
      increase the brightness of commercial LEDs.&#xD;
    Photonic crystals are composed of dielectric materials in which holes are&#xD;
      regularly spaced in a lattice arrangement. In the same way that electrons&#xD;
      with specific energies cannot travel through a semiconductor like silicon&#xD;
      because of an energy band gap, photonic crystals have photonic&#xD;
      band gaps that block wavelengths of light at a certain range of&#xD;
      frequencies and prevent them from propagating. This band structure is&#xD;
      created using man-made periodic structures rather than natural crystal&#xD;
      structures. Physicists are therefore free to use patterns that do not&#xD;
      occur in nature and fabricate these in well understood materials such as&#xD;
      silicon.&#xD;
    Researchers at Southampton found that creating an array of microscopic&#xD;
      holes a couple of hundred nanometres deep in dielectric layers of a&#xD;
      silicon nitride substrate [3.2] disrupted the periodicity of the&#xD;
      lattice structure, allowing them to bend light around corners at&#xD;
      sub-millimetre scale while avoiding light escaping at the corners (which&#xD;
      would weaken the signal) [3.3]. Further research demonstrated that&#xD;
      multiple optical functions and complex systems could be implemented at&#xD;
      high density on a single silicon chip, paving the way for low-cost,&#xD;
      high-volume production of integrated optical devices. A US patent was&#xD;
      applied for an invention relating to optical devices incorporating&#xD;
      structures exhibiting a photonic band gap in April 2001 and granted in&#xD;
      2005 [3.4].&#xD;
    This intellectual property formed the basis of the establishment in July&#xD;
      2001 of Mesophotonics Ltd. (a partnership between Baumberg, Parker and&#xD;
      BTG, a company specialising in commercialising technologies) to further&#xD;
      develop the photonic crystal devices and take them to market. In 2004&#xD;
      Professor Baumberg received the Royal Society's prestigious Mullard Award&#xD;
      for his work in nanoscience and nanotechnology and for his contribution to&#xD;
      the national prosperity of the UK through the spin-out company&#xD;
      Mesophotonics Ltd. in developing optical chips. Professor Baumberg&#xD;
      continued to contribute to the development of nanophotonic devices until&#xD;
      he moved to the University of Cambridge in 2007. Research, development and&#xD;
      implementation of photonics quasi-crystals in LED epitaxy has been&#xD;
      followed up by Dr Martin Charlton, (1999-present, Reader at ECS) one of&#xD;
      the co-founders of Mesophotonics, who trained in the group led by&#xD;
      Professor Baumberg. Dr Martin Charlton is currently collaborating with&#xD;
      Prof Pavlos Lagoudakis (2006-present; Deputy Head for Research, P&amp;amp;A)&#xD;
      in tuning photonic crystal geometries for optimising colour conversion in&#xD;
      LEDs [3.7].&#xD;

    Research by the University of Southampton's Astronomy Group has gone&#xD;
      beyond solving galactic riddles, radically improving the capability of&#xD;
      security agencies to detect dirty bomb threats and contributing to tighter&#xD;
      safety procedures in the nuclear industry.&#xD;
    Responding to US government calls for technology that could be used at&#xD;
      ports to detect suspect radioactive materials, spin-out company Symetrica&#xD;
      [5.1] set out to adapt the Southampton team's original gamma-ray detector,&#xD;
      which had performed successfully in space exploration. Existing detection&#xD;
      systems, housed in `portals', were unable to discriminate between&#xD;
      different threat and natural radiation sources. Symetrica developed its&#xD;
      original gamma-ray detector &amp;#8212; its spectroscopic capabilities enable it to&#xD;
      distinguish different radiation sources and accurately identify threat&#xD;
      materials hidden in heavily shielded containers &amp;#8212; to make a system that&#xD;
      could be used in a portal and in a handheld detector as a second layer of&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
    In 2006 Symetrica partnered with Smiths Detection, a world-leading&#xD;
      provider of detection systems for X-rays, explosives and traces of&#xD;
      radioactive materials, which led to a $222m contract from the US&#xD;
      Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Domestic Nuclear Detection Office&#xD;
      (DNDO) to develop next-generation radiation detection and identification&#xD;
      systems. This move was crucial in giving Symetrica access to the key US&#xD;
      government market. In September 2008 Smiths Detection announced the launch&#xD;
      of the partnership's High Performance Radioisotope Identifier (HPRID), a&#xD;
      next-generation handheld device for detecting and identifying highly&#xD;
      enriched uranium, plutonium and other radioactive materials. A choice of&#xD;
      either a NaI or LaBr3 crystal and a neutron detector identify&#xD;
      and analyse the specific potential threat. The HPRID was based on&#xD;
      Symetrica's original Discovery&amp;#8482; technology for isotope detection and&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;
    The collaboration between Symetrica and Smiths led to further success in&#xD;
      2011 when their RadSeeker handheld radioisotope identifier, which&#xD;
      superseded the HPRID, was approved by the DHS's DNDO as its primary&#xD;
      radiological handheld detector device [5.2, 5.3] to help port and border&#xD;
      personnel evaluate cargo, containers and vehicles as part of the US&#xD;
      government's counter-terrorism efforts.&#xD;
    Smiths received an initial production order for $4.5m in May 2011, built&#xD;
      around Symetrica's key isotope identification and spectrum stabilisation&#xD;
      technologies employed in this device. In 2012, the DHS announced the&#xD;
      purchase of RadSeeker DL instruments for $8.3m. As a result of this&#xD;
      decision, Symetrica's technology was deployed by the Honolulu Emergency&#xD;
      Services Department, through US Government grant funding, to screen&#xD;
      tsunami debris as it reached Hawaii in the aftermath of the Fukushima&#xD;
      disaster [5.4].&#xD;
    Symetrica has grown into an international company with 26 employees in&#xD;
      the UK and the USA &amp;#8212; a number that is expected to grow by 30% in 2013-2014&#xD;
      with RadSeeker entering full production. Its forecast turnover is &amp;#163;10m.&#xD;
      Symetrica Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Symetrica Ltd, was founded in&#xD;
      the USA, with a manufacturing and testing facility in Maynard, MA.&#xD;
      Symetrica has a strong R&amp;amp;D programme in the UK itself, and has funded&#xD;
      PhD studentships at the Universities of Southampton and Surrey. It has&#xD;
      also successfully bid for more than &amp;#163;100k of DTI/EPSRC funding on the&#xD;
      basis of collaborative research with the University of Southampton [5.5,&#xD;
      5.6].&#xD;
    Symetrica's shift in market focus from space to security is the key to&#xD;
      its current success and is attributable to a decision taken by commercial&#xD;
      advisers at SETsquared, an organisation that supports spin-outs from the&#xD;
      five universities of Southampton, Exeter, Bristol, Bath and Surrey.&#xD;
      SETsquared matched the Southampton astronomy team with a mentor, Heddwyn&#xD;
      Davies, now the chief executive of Symetrica, who targeted the security&#xD;
      sector as Symetrica's primary market.&#xD;
    Symetrica's Homeland Security portfolio now includes scalable, 3He-free
      neutron detectors, inexpensive Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs) that can&#xD;
      reduce nuisance alarms alarm rates during cargo screening and RPMs&#xD;
      equipped with crystal spectrometers that provide a greatly enhanced&#xD;
      isotope-identification capability. With all three of these technologies&#xD;
      entered into the European Illicit Trafficking Radiation Assessment Program&#xD;
      (ITRAP+10), Symetrica's footprint on the Homeland Security Market has&#xD;
      significantly increased. A prototype portal monitor, trialled at the Port&#xD;
      of Felixstowe, demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing naturally&#xD;
      occurring radioactive materials from potential threat materials. The trial&#xD;
      system reduced the number of manual secondary inspections of cargo by&#xD;
      customs personnel at the port by ~80%.&#xD;
    Already partnered with Smith's detection, Symetrica is now in discussions&#xD;
      with two other market-leading prime contractors who wish to use their&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
    The story behind the Symetrica spin-out was highlighted as an example of&#xD;
      best practice by The Engineer magazine in 2011 [5.7], and in&#xD;
      February 2012 the Duke of York visited Symetrica's headquarters at the&#xD;
      University's Science Park, to learn how its technology is winning export&#xD;
      sales for the UK [5.8].&#xD;
    Symetrica continues to be research-active and has filed 15 patents since&#xD;
      its launch. There is a programme of continued collaboration between the&#xD;
      School of Physics and Astronomy and Symetrica in the field of detector&#xD;
      development. Funded studentships, supervised by Bird, were completed in&#xD;
      2009 and 2011 and the findings fed into products now offered by Symetrica.&#xD;
      The first student (Dr C Burt) carried out the initial development for&#xD;
      large area PVT detectors to act as low-cost replacements for traditional&#xD;
      scintillation counters. The second student (Dr M Foster) worked on&#xD;
      extending these detectors in the search for a replacement for Helium-3&#xD;
      neutron detectors and is now a Symetrica employee in their research&#xD;
      department. Both these developments are now marketed as components within&#xD;
      the Symetrica Radiation Portal Monitor (RPM) range, which offer a &amp;gt;75%&#xD;
      nuisance alarm reduction and improved isotope identification capability&#xD;
      compared to other available systems.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    The University of Southampton's distinguished body of work on the design&#xD;
      of technology for gamma-ray detection and imaging has informed new&#xD;
      counter-terrorism practices. Technological advances arising from the&#xD;
      research have been crucial to delivering significant benefits in the&#xD;
      fields of homeland security and nuclear safety &amp;#8212; the latter particularly&#xD;
      in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. A spin-out company, Symetrica,&#xD;
      currently employs 26 people in the UK and the USA, has a forecast turnover&#xD;
      of more than &amp;#163;10 million for 2013-14 and has been recognised as an example&#xD;
      of best practice. It is a technological leader in the field of radioactive&#xD;
      isotope identification.&#xD;

    Research into designing technology for gamma-ray detection and imaging&#xD;
      began in the University of Southampton's Astronomy Group in the 1980s and&#xD;
      continued throughout the next two decades, underpinning the formation of&#xD;
      spin-out company Symetrica Ltd in 2002. Symetrica's core technologies&#xD;
      resulted from a combination of the research activities carried out within&#xD;
      the group and specifically within the teams working in instrument design&#xD;
      and construction.&#xD;
    Dr Tony Bird, Reader in the School of Physics and Astronomy&#xD;
      (1987-present), led the advancement of small low-power&#xD;
      scintillator-photodiode radiation detectors for the development programme&#xD;
      of the European Space Agency's (ESA) INTEGRAL space telescope [3.1, G1,&#xD;
      G2]. The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory is the most&#xD;
      sensitive gamma-ray observatory to date and, through the analysis of&#xD;
      gamma-ray bursts in space, aims to solve some of astronomy's biggest&#xD;
      mysteries.&#xD;
    As a postdoctoral researcher, Bird optimised the design of gamma-ray&#xD;
      detectors, creating a technology (paper published in 1993) that was more&#xD;
      cost-effective and robust than existing detectors (standard NaI(Tl)/PMT&#xD;
      combinations) and, crucially, did not require a high-voltage supply that&#xD;
      might cause equipment failure in space. These sensitive radiation&#xD;
      detectors paved the way for highly segmented 2D gamma-ray detector arrays,&#xD;
      which can provide high-resolution spectroscopy as well as imaging&#xD;
      capability.&#xD;
    Essential gamma-ray imaging technologies were developed [G1, G2] by teams&#xD;
      led by Professor A Dean, now a Professor Emeritus within the Astronomy&#xD;
      Group following his retirement in 2009, and Dr D Ramsden, who retired in&#xD;
      1996 and founded Symetrica in 2002, where he is now chief technical&#xD;
      officer and head of research. The resulting imaging systems relied on the&#xD;
      temporal or spatial modulation of the incident gamma-ray flux using high-Z&#xD;
      materials and produced images of far higher quality than previously&#xD;
      possible. These systems are now ubiquitous in high-energy imaging systems&#xD;
      for space astronomy and also form the basis for `stand-off imaging' (i.e.&#xD;
      from distance) in homeland security and nuclear industry applications&#xD;
      [3.2, 3.3, G3].&#xD;
    Led by Dr Fan Lei, a postdoctoral researcher at the time (left&#xD;
      Southampton in 2000), research into instrument modelling guided the&#xD;
      INTEGRAL Mass Model project [3.4, G5] an independent and uniform&#xD;
      instrument and spacecraft modelling program for ESA. Using data on mass&#xD;
      distribution and chemical composition of material in the instruments, Dr&#xD;
      Lei formed a Monte Carlo model of the whole payload to assess the&#xD;
      performance of each instrument and identify any flaws. It was the first&#xD;
      time simulations had provided detailed and useful satellite design input.&#xD;
      Simulations were used to optimise the response of the detectors to gamma&#xD;
      rays, inform the calibration strategy and support data analysis after&#xD;
      launch. Simulations were also used in designing the detector geometry to&#xD;
      ensure high and uniform light collection from the scintillation counters,&#xD;
      producing the best possible spectral resolution.&#xD;
    Research into spectral response modelling through signal processing and&#xD;
      mathematical modelling led to some of Symetrica's core technology for&#xD;
      isotope identification [3.5, 3.6]. These methods allow a detector spectrum&#xD;
      to be deconvolved into the component isotope signatures, enabling accurate&#xD;
      identification and quantification of radioactive materials.&#xD;
    The combination of these technologies provided Symetrica with an initial&#xD;
      portfolio of radiation detection products and continues to inform the&#xD;
      company's development of innovative radiation detection solutions.&#xD;

    The process (from research to impact)&#xD;
    The spin-out company Covesion was itself spun out from a parent company,&#xD;
      Stratophase (another spin-out of the University started 2003), in 2009, to&#xD;
      better focus on research and development of its nonlinear optical&#xD;
      materials product line [5.1]. Following the first sales of PPLN to&#xD;
      GEC-Marconi, PPLN research has developed into a successful commercial&#xD;
      venture since the formation of the separate company Covesion. With fresh&#xD;
      venture capital investment, Covesion developed new Intellectual Property&#xD;
      around poling of MgO-doped PPLN for high power applications, technology&#xD;
      that had been pioneered at Southampton. At its inception Covesion&#xD;
      comprised only the two former Stratophase staff members working on PPLN.&#xD;
      Since then it has created five high-tech jobs and achieved sales worth&#xD;
      &amp;#163;2.1million over three years, 95 per cent of these sales being to overseas&#xD;
      customers [5.2, 5.3].&#xD;
    Economic impact&#xD;
    Covesion customers include some of the world's most successful companies&#xD;
      and prestigious research institutes, including some University-based&#xD;
      former PPLN research groups, not all of which can be named explicitly&#xD;
      here, for reasons of confidentiality, but span the areas of defence,&#xD;
      communications, laser manufacturing and medicine. New business has&#xD;
        therefore been created. The list includes major corporations such as&#xD;
      [text removed for publication]. [5.2]. From recent measurements of the&#xD;
      performance of these nonlinear engineered crystals, where 45W of green&#xD;
      light has been generated from an input near-infrared laser beam,&#xD;
      [reported by Stanford University, in 2012 [5.4] it is clear that&#xD;
      high-power lasers can now be built in a far more cost-effective manner&#xD;
      using Covesion components, and such impressive results have led to further&#xD;
      patent activity [5.5].&#xD;
    Another area that demonstrates economic impact relates to the use&#xD;
      of these engineered crystals in laser projection systems for presentations&#xD;
      and displays that have brighter, clearer colours but which use less energy&#xD;
      than conventional light bulb-based units, and therefore represents an&#xD;
      activity that has an impact on the environment also (management of&#xD;
        energy). Consumer demand in this area is growing rapidly, as&#xD;
      products are marketed for home cinema, desktop projectors and&#xD;
      rear-projection. Future opportunities are projectors integrated into&#xD;
      mobile phones and laptops, as well as use in medical screening and aero&#xD;
      defence equipment. Covesion has entered into a license agreement and&#xD;
      technology transfer programme with a leading projector company, [text&#xD;
      removed for publication]. [5.2].&#xD;
    The final claim under economic impact is that the crystals sold by&#xD;
      Covesion are essential parts of new laser systems and applications, which&#xD;
      has a significant value to global trade. The crystals are integrated into&#xD;
      high-end products which are sold by Covesion customers, so the leverage&#xD;
      effect is considerable, and vital to the success of these companies. The&#xD;
      company's own analysis of sales of these systems and the volume of&#xD;
      products shipped suggests that the total worldwide market value of&#xD;
      Covesion-enabled commerce is greater than US$25m per year (hence US$100m&#xD;
      since 2009) [5.2]. A ready example concerns Covesion products that are&#xD;
      used in short-pulse fibre lasers which are sold by at least three&#xD;
      manufacturers. Publicised users to date include Oclaro Inc., one of the&#xD;
      world's largest suppliers of optical communications equipment, the&#xD;
      world-leading universities Harvard and Stanford and leading governmental&#xD;
      research organisations such as NASA.&#xD;
    Health Impacts&#xD;
    Other key applications for Covesion products lay in the area of medical&#xD;
      imaging, where 2-photon fluorescence microscopy that uses Covesion&#xD;
      crystals enables imaging of living tissue, an area of immediate concern&#xD;
      for real-time medical diagnostics. Covesion have also played a key role in&#xD;
      the consortium working on the EU-funded CROSS TRAP (Coherently-enhanced&#xD;
      Raman One-beam Standoff Spectroscopic Tracing of Airborne Pollutants)&#xD;
      project [5.6], which addresses the development of a novel laser remote&#xD;
      sensing technique for probing air at a distance for hazards such as&#xD;
      biochemicals, bacterial threats and explosive materials. Both of these&#xD;
      areas fall under the heading of new diagnostics for medical&#xD;
        technologies.&#xD;
    A final area which falls under the heading of quality of life impact,&#xD;
      concerns the impact on society through provision of essential components&#xD;
      in systems that protect the public and armed forces of several nations &amp;#8212; preventing future loss of life. Under UK export licenses, Covesion&#xD;
      crystals are used as wavelength conversion components in laser&#xD;
      countermeasure systems on over 90 commercial aircraft [5.2]. These involve&#xD;
      directing laser beams towards an approaching missile, causing it to veer&#xD;
      off course. [text removed for publication]. [5.7].&#xD;
    In conclusion, for the sake of completeness, a reference has been&#xD;
      included that describes global impact from the technical viewpoint, which&#xD;
      provides a list of publications from Covesion customers [5.8].&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Covesion, a company that was spun out of the University of Southampton,&#xD;
      focuses on research and development of high-value engineered nonlinear&#xD;
      crystal materials, that find widespread use in the laser, defence and&#xD;
      display sectors. The impacts of their work fall under the headings of economic,&#xD;
      via job creation and investment, health, through&#xD;
      application of their products in medical imaging, and the environment,&#xD;
      via detection of airborne pollutants and remote sensing. The company is&#xD;
      now a multi-million pound business that has attracted more than &amp;#163;1m in US&#xD;
      investment and won UK export orders around the world. The global value of&#xD;
      Covesion-enabled commerce since the company's inception in 2009 is&#xD;
      estimated to be in excess of US$100m.&#xD;

    Nonlinear optical materials are used to manipulate some of the&#xD;
      fundamental properties of light (almost invariably laser light) in terms&#xD;
      of its wavelength, bandwidth or spectral content, by the judicious choice&#xD;
      or manipulation of their nonlinear optical coefficients. The field of&#xD;
      nonlinear optical research has grown rapidly following the invention of&#xD;
      the laser in 1960. Although it may be comparatively easy to demonstrate&#xD;
      laser action in a particular material, unless the lasing wavelength&#xD;
      produced is optimum for the end application, nonlinear optical techniques&#xD;
      are needed to convert the primary wavelength into the one required, and to&#xD;
      do this with the highest efficiency possible.&#xD;
    One technique for achieving such efficient wavelength conversion is&#xD;
      called `quasi-phase-matching', which involves the manipulation of a&#xD;
      crystal structure by periodically modifying its internal crystalline&#xD;
      properties (specifically modifying the sign of specific nonlinear&#xD;
      coefficients) at length scales that fall into the few micron range.&#xD;
      Suggested first in the early 1960s, little practical progress was made in&#xD;
      the area until the early 1990s, when techniques emerged to successfully&#xD;
      fabricate these engineered crystals with the correct periodicity and&#xD;
      quality. Three research groups at Sony corporation in Japan, Stanford&#xD;
      University in California, and the laser group at Southampton (see below&#xD;
      for details), independently developed and refined the fabrication&#xD;
      techniques required, using lithium niobate crystals as the optimum&#xD;
      starting material, to produce the final product known as PPLN&#xD;
      (periodically poled lithium niobate). In 1994, researchers at Southampton&#xD;
      published a key result using a novel approach which involved periodic&#xD;
      structuring using liquid electrodes [3.1] which produced the small periods&#xD;
      required with excellent fidelity, a result that followed soon after the&#xD;
      first reports from Sony in 1993 and Stanford University in 1994. Research&#xD;
      followed into the use of light to control periodic poling [3.2, G1, G3]&#xD;
      and fundamental work on structures within periodically poled materials was&#xD;
      undertaken via collaborative research [3.3] to further refine and&#xD;
      characterise all aspects of the final material precision and quality.&#xD;
    Progress in the underpinning research extended to the use of periodically&#xD;
      poled materials for efficient wavelength conversion into the blue (short&#xD;
      wavelength) where 450mW of blue light was generated [3.4] and&#xD;
      near-infrared (long wavelength) operation [3.5, G2] as well as the&#xD;
      adoption of optical waveguide technology which was developed in&#xD;
      conjunction with periodic poling [3.6] all of which presented further&#xD;
      opportunities to expand the range of future products. In particular, one&#xD;
      of the most commercially important contributions to the technology lay in&#xD;
      developing a simple process for periodic poling of magnesium oxide doped&#xD;
      crystals, which allows them to be used in high-power applications and at&#xD;
      higher temperatures.&#xD;
    In 2009, the spin-out company Covesion was founded by Professor Peter&#xD;
      G.R. Smith, who joined the Physics Department in 1994 as Research Fellow,&#xD;
      initially with just two staff members, to develop a PPLN business that&#xD;
      revolved around these new-generation magnesium oxide doped crystals.&#xD;
    Researchers who made significant contributions to this work include:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Professor David Hanna, who instigated the research into periodic&#xD;
        poling technology, joined Physics department in 1983, Deputy Director of&#xD;
        the Optoelectronics Research Centre &amp;#8212;ORC-from 1989 until his retirement&#xD;
        in 2007&#xD;
      Professor Robert Eason, who worked in the area of lithium niobate&#xD;
        material science from the late 1990s, joined Physics department in 1989,&#xD;
        Deputy Director of the ORC since 2007.&#xD;
      Professor Peter G.R. Smith, founder of Covesion, joined the Physics&#xD;
        Department in 1994 as Research Fellow.&#xD;

        1990, and continued as Research Fellow until 1998.&#xD;

    The Process: from research to impact
    The invention of the MOF has led to a step-change in a range of
      applications of fibre-optic technology, and created new business sectors
      within the global optoelectronics industry which has adopted this new form
      of fibre not only to improve or extend the performance of existing product
      lines, but also to exploit its unique properties and develop revolutionary
      new products and services. Several of these are already having
      transformational impact across important application sectors. The biggest
      impact so far is the use of MOF technology to create a revolutionary new
      laser device, the Supercontinuum Fibre Laser (SFL), which
      generates white light that can be &amp;gt; 1 million times brighter than
      possible by pre-existing technologies, and exploits the unique nonlinear
      optical properties in MOFs [5.1].
    1. Economic Impact (creation of new business sectors and adoption of
        new technology)
    Creation of a local spin-out: The invention of MOFs and subsequent
      early research on nonlinear MOFs conducted at the ORC led to the creation
      and continuing success of the spin-off company Fianium, which was
      founded in 2003 by Professor Anatoly Grudinin, and is now one of the
      world's leading suppliers of compact, all-fiberised supercontinuum
      sources. During the period between 2008 and 2013 the company more than
      doubled in size. It currently has an annual turnover of ~&amp;#163;10million
      and employs more than 50 people in the Southampton area, many of
      which are post-doctoral researchers coming from the ORC. The growth has
      earned the company two Queen's awards: for International Trade
      (2009) and Innovation (2012) [5.1]. Fianium maintains strong links with
      the ORC, where it funds research at the level of &amp;#163;100k per annum, and
      exports more than 90% of its products, thereby generating revenue and
      profits for the UK [5.1].
    Creation of a new business sector: Besides Fianium, several other
      companies worldwide have been created to commercialise supercontinuum
      sources: NKT Photonics (Denmark), Menlo Systems (Germany) and Toptica
      Lasers (Germany). Furthermore, MOFs are also sold as a product in their
      own right by companies such as OFS (Denmark, USA), Fujikura (Japan) and
      Yangtze Optical Fibre Company (China). Most other major fibre
      manufacturers (e.g. Corning, Furukawa) have established large MOF research
      programs and capabilities, even though they do not currently openly
      advertise MOF products. [5.2]. The estimated global market for MOF and
        SFLs in 2011 was $96 million and this is predicted to rise to $621
      million in 2016 [5.3].
    2. Health impacts
    The use of MOFs to generate compact supercontinuum lasers has enabled the
      development of new biomedical instrumentation and diagnostics. With the
      very recent commercial availability of SFL-enabled products, MOF
      technology is now beginning to be used in laboratories and hospitals
      across the world to enchance our understanding of biological systems and
      to aid diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions for improving the
      health and well-being of the general public, as illustrated in the
      examples below:
    In the area of biological imaging, these MOF-enabled broadband
      laser sources have a multitude of applications, including the areas of
      fluorescence lifetime imaging, flow cytometry, and in-vivo optical
      molecular imaging. In broadband spectroscopy, high-resolution
      optical coherence tomography and endoscopic illumination,
      these devices are being applied across a range of important medical
      applications. SFLs, using Fianium products, have been key to the
      development of a technique developed by Stefan Hell from the Max Planck
      Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G&amp;#246;ttingen to push the resolution of
      conventional microscopy beyond the conventional diffraction limit, thereby
      achieving significantly sharper levels of detail in biological
      imaging [5.5]. Scientific instrument manufacturers have started to
      integrate supercontinuum sources in their products. In 2012 Japan-based
      manufacturer of precision instruments HORIBA integrated the high intensity
      and broad wavelength range of a supercontinuum laser into a commercial
        spectrofluorometer for improved diagnostic capability [5.6]. In
      2013, Leica Microsystems &amp;#8212; a world leader in microscopy and imaging
      solutions &amp;#8212; began marketing products that use supercontinuum lasers as
      "the ultimate source for confocal microscopy" [5.7]. Manufacturer
      Bioptigen develops non-invasive ophthalmic imaging systems,
      generating high-resolution images of the cornea and retina. Early in 2013
      the company integrated a supercontinuum source into its products "to
      achieve a breakthrough in ophthalmic imaging for preclinical research"
      [5.8].
    3. Impact on public and professional services
    In the field of metrology, supercontinuum lasers based on the new MOF
      technology have enabled ultrastable frequency combs that provide a direct
      link between optical and microwave frequencies. This has made the
      measurements of frequency, time and length far more accurate than hitherto
      possible, with profound impact on both the fundamental science program and
      commercial services, such as the distribution of accurate time
      through an optical fibre network and time stamping services for financial
      transactions, now offered by the National Physics Laboratory (NPL) [5.4]
      and other such standards labs worldwide. This is an important contributor
      to global international trade and world stock-markets.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    This research has led to the creation of new business sectors in
      laser development for medical and healthcare applications, which has
      enabled the creation of a world-wide market worth US$96 million in 2011,
      and a local spin-out, Fianium Ltd, which now has more than 50 employees
      and an annual turnover of around &amp;#163;10 million. Exploiting a radically new
      optical component invented at the University of Southampton, the
      microstructured optical fibre (MOF), this research has led to economic
      benefit through the creation of hundreds of jobs worldwide, and enabled
      the development of new diagnostic and medical technologies.

      Applications
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Metallurgy and Materials</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    Optical fibres have a vast and ever-increasing range of practical
      applications that range from underpinning the internet infrastructure to
      the development of high-precision medical instrumentation. The technology
      enhances the lives of most of society and is critical to many
      manufacturing and leisure industries. The underpinning research,
      undertaken between 1993 and 2013 at the Optoelectronics Research Centre
      (ORC), comprises an extensive body of work on the development of
      microstructured optical fibres (MOFs), also known as photonic crystal
      fibres (PCFs), which transmit light via a fundamentally different
      mechanism to pre-existing fibres: instead of the conventional solid core,
      MOFs contain a sophisticated arrangement of microscopic air holes
      incorporated in the fibre cross section that extend along the entire fibre
      length. The underpinning research, funded by a continuous series of large
      EPSRC grants [3.7-3.10], includes the development of the original
      ground-breaking idea, early theoretical work predicting their unique
      properties, fabrication of the first PCF in 1995, and more recent work on
      improving the design and manufacture of MOFs and demonstrating practical
      approaches to realising novel MOF-based laser sources. The work has
      spawned a whole new field of research with &amp;gt; 8,200 journal papers
      written to date on the topic (source: Web of Science, September 2013), all
      of which have resulted from the first MOF work at Southampton [3.2].
    Nature of the research insights or findings which relate to the impact
        or benefit claimed:
    
      First numerical demonstration of the possibility to obtain bandgap
        guidance in hollow core MOFs representing a fundamentally new means to
        guide light in an optical fibre [3.1] (1995);
      The first demonstration of a light guiding MOF [3.2] (1995-1996);
      The development of the first numerical method capable of modelling
        MOFs, which highlighted their exceptional dispersive and nonlinear
        properties [3.3] (1999);
      First measurement of the high nonlinearity of small core MOFs, which
        generated enormous interest in these fibres and ultimately paved the way
        to the realisation of modern all-fibre based supercontinuum sources
        [3.4] (1999);
      First demonstration of supercontinuum generation using a short pulse
        Ytterbium doped fibre laser with a suitably designed PCF, the
        configuration currently exploited by commercial supercontinuum vendors,
        such as Fianium Ltd. [3.5] (2002).
      Extensive contributions to the improvement of the manufacturing
        process of silica (US-PATENT-6968107,
        2005) and non-silica based MOFs (US-PATENT-7155099,
        2006);
      Improved physical understanding of supercontinuum generation and
        technological improvements to increase the nonlinearity of MOFs
        responsible for its occurrence [3.6] (2006).

    The impact for our Bragg grating technology spans several related areas,&#xD;
      which reflect the intrinsic characteristics of fibre (FBG) and planar&#xD;
      (PBG) geometries. Impact here relate to Economic (spin-out,
        creation of new business and adoption of new processes) as well as Environmental&#xD;
      (achievement of environmental (green) objectives).&#xD;
    FBG research has been directed at a wide range of technologies,&#xD;
      but the focus here is for NIF, the National Ignition Facility, in&#xD;
      Livermore, California, U.S.A. This is a massive enterprise aimed at fusion&#xD;
      research, (which is hoped will replace current fission-based power&#xD;
      stations) and which has at its heart, ORC-developed passive and active&#xD;
      fibre Bragg grating technology.&#xD;
    The FBG process that led from research to impact was via the ORC&#xD;
      involvement from an early stage of the developments of NIF, and concerned&#xD;
      the contributed key technology and knowhow that was developed through FBG&#xD;
      and optical amplifier designs. The 192 laser beams in NIF originate from a&#xD;
      single 5cm long DFB fibre-grating-laser master-oscillator conceived as a&#xD;
      concept and first demonstrated at the ORC. The critical&#xD;
      requirement is that this laser operates at the precise wavelength required&#xD;
      for all downstream laser and amplifier components [5.1, 5.2], and was&#xD;
      chosen because of its exceptional wavelength and power-stability. Precise&#xD;
      pulse control in the preamplifiers and the signal delivery fibres within&#xD;
      NIF is done with 30cm long ORC-fabricated passive chirped FBGs. The&#xD;
      critical operational requirements (long length, exact matching of passive&#xD;
      dispersion-orders and low phase-noise) can only be achieved with&#xD;
      ORC-fabricated gratings as there are no commercial suppliers or any other&#xD;
      research organisations that are capable of delivering these requirements.&#xD;
      It was this unique capability that led to NIF scientists&#xD;
      collaborating directly with the ORC [5.3].&#xD;
    The nature of the impact is the possibility that fusion-based&#xD;
      energy generation can provide that unlimited source of clean energy that&#xD;
      would solve one of our most fundamental problems. Fusion has been termed&#xD;
      the 'holy grail' and `game-changer' of future energy technology, and it&#xD;
      has vast potential to help meet the world's future energy challenges. The&#xD;
      success and promising concepts demonstrated at NIF are already spilling&#xD;
      over into beneficiaries in Europe, China and Russia where several&#xD;
      facilities are under construction creating new jobs in the industry, and&#xD;
      promoting high-tech laser-development [5.4]. While it is recognised that&#xD;
      there are many challenges remaining to be solved, it is undeniable that&#xD;
      cheap and renewable energy is perhaps number one on the wish-list of every&#xD;
      government. The world is closely following the fusion energy programme,&#xD;
      which, should it prove successful, would solve one of the most fundamental&#xD;
      problems of energy security. It is a testament to its&#xD;
      significance that grating-technology researched and developed at the ORC&#xD;
      lies at the very heart of the quest for controlled fusion, and that a&#xD;
      significant step towards this goal was reached on 5-July 2012 by NIF&#xD;
      reaching its 1.8MJ, 500TW milestone [5.5], and on 13-August 2013 when, for&#xD;
      the first time ever from any fusion facility in the world, the amount of&#xD;
      energy released through the fusion reaction exceeded the amount of energy&#xD;
      being absorbed by the fusion fuel [5.6].&#xD;
    The PBG process started from 1999, when Bragg gratings in planar&#xD;
      geometries were developed, together with the first proof of concept for&#xD;
      sensors. Prompted by feedback from industry, the University of Southampton&#xD;
      patented the inventions (e.g. US Patent No. 7,440,653, filed May-2003,&#xD;
      issued October-2008) and attracted VC-funding to establish the spin-out&#xD;
      Stratophase, which initially had two core technologies, UV-written Bragg&#xD;
      gratings and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN). The second of&#xD;
      these was itself spun out in 2009 in another company, Covesion, which is&#xD;
      the subject of a different case study. Soon after the first VC-funding,&#xD;
      two patents were filed on evanescent field sensors utilising the original&#xD;
      grating patent (US Patent No. 7,715,005, filed July-2005, issued May-2010,&#xD;
      US Patent No. 7,541,573, filed July-2005, issued June-2009).&#xD;
    The nature of the impact and beneficiaries: Stratophase has led to&#xD;
      high-tech employment (presently 12 staff), investment by US&#xD;
      Investors of &amp;#163;6.8m, and cumulative sales and development contracts worth&#xD;
      &amp;#163;3.2m [5.7]. Users of this technology include:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      CPI, Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Greenbiologics, for feedback control during&#xD;
        bio-pharma production.&#xD;
      DSTL and the MoD who successfully demonstrated detection of live agent&#xD;
        bio-hazards at Porton Down including ricin and anthrax, providing the UK&#xD;
        with a national capability for detection of these bio-hazards&#xD;
        [5.8].&#xD;
      A number of life sciences companies [5.9] via the launch of a new set&#xD;
        of products (Stratophase Ranger&amp;#8482;) offering off-the-shelf solutions for&#xD;
        batch monitoring and process-control.&#xD;
      The University of Cambridge's Institute of Biotechnology, Bristol&#xD;
        Industrial and Research Associates and the Chelsea Technologies Group.&#xD;
        In June 2011 Stratophase reported the successful completion of a&#xD;
        feasibility study into a portable sensor unit for detecting foot-and-mouth
            disease, which could allow veterinarians, inspectors and&#xD;
        even farmers to diagnose the disease much more quickly than is currently&#xD;
        possible using laboratory analysis [5.9].&#xD;
      A contract with Biral, for the development and demonstration of live&#xD;
        agent air-sampled detection capability at the Porton Down BSL 4&#xD;
        lab for the most toxic materials (e.g. Anthrax). The contract, awarded&#xD;
        by the MOD/DSTL, was for &amp;#163;1.2m and is an excellent example of University&#xD;
        research having impact on the work of Government scientists for greater&#xD;
        protection of the UK population. [5.10]&#xD;

    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Ultra-precise Bragg grating writing-technology, invented in the&#xD;
      Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC), has led to impacts in the areas of&#xD;
      security, safety, detection of bio-hazards and the underpinning&#xD;
      laser technology currently being pursued for clean energy&#xD;
      generation for future energy security. This case study highlights two&#xD;
      aspects of the technology namely: planar-based for optical&#xD;
      microchip sensors in areas such as portable detection of biohazards, which&#xD;
      has resulted in the spin-out Stratophase, and fibre-based,&#xD;
      inside the US National Ignition Facility (NIF), the world's largest laser&#xD;
      system, based in California, built for fusion-energy research, which has&#xD;
      ORC fabricated fibre Bragg gratings within its laser amplifier chains.&#xD;
      These ultra-high precision laser-written engineered gratings have enabled&#xD;
      important advances in biosecurity, management of environmental hazards and&#xD;
      clean energy research.&#xD;

    The underpinning research uses a process of UV (244nm) stroboscopic laser&#xD;
      direct-writing which has been applied in both geometries. For fibre-based&#xD;
      gratings (FBG), the underpinning research has been focussed&#xD;
      on ORC specialty fibres with combined functionality of high rare-earth&#xD;
      concentrations and high levels of photosensitivity, and&#xD;
      inscription/fabrication-techniques capable of producing gratings of very&#xD;
      long length (&amp;gt;1metre) with unprecedented phase- and amplitude-&#xD;
      complexity. For planar-based gratings (PBG) the challenge is&#xD;
      to obtain highly uniform waveguides and gratings. A technique was&#xD;
      developed to write the gratings and waveguide simultaneously. This&#xD;
      approach allows the creation of sensors in a fluidic compatible format&#xD;
      that allows for sensing of multiple chemical or biochemical targets.&#xD;
    Fibre Bragg Grating underpinning research has focussed on&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Development of high-concentration rare-earth doped (e.g. Yb3+,&#xD;
        Er3+, or a combination of both) photosensitive fibres&#xD;
        suitable for direct writing of short-cavity, high-efficiency,&#xD;
        single-frequency fibre-lasers with output powers in the 10's of mW&#xD;
        range, including research on glass spectroscopy and design of&#xD;
        application-specific grating spatial and phase profiles.&#xD;
      Demonstration and characterisation of high-performance rare-earth&#xD;
        doped distributed feedback fibre-lasers yielding ultra-low phase- and&#xD;
        intensity-noise. This work led to the first demonstration of all-fibre&#xD;
        lasers operating in the important 1.5&amp;#181;m telecommunications wavelength&#xD;
        band [3.1 and US Patent 5,771,251], and soon after to the&#xD;
        demonstration of fibre- lasers in Yb3+ co-doped fibres&#xD;
        operating in the 1&amp;#181;m wavelength region, as required for the front end of&#xD;
        the NIF laser-system [3.2]. These distributed feedback fibre-lasers, all&#xD;
        of which are based on our original technology, are now sold by several&#xD;
        companies (NKT Photonics, Redfern Optical Components, IDIL Fibres&#xD;
        Optiques, etc)&#xD;
      Design of FBG fabrication methods to achieve full control of the&#xD;
        phase- and amplitude-profile of grating-devices to allow for very&#xD;
        complex apodisation and phase-shifted all-fibre structures [3.3 and US&#xD;
          Patent Nos. 6,072,926 &amp;amp; 6,334,013 &amp;amp; 6,384,977].&#xD;
    &#xD;
    Planar Bragg Grating underpinning research has focussed on&#xD;
    &#xD;
      New ways of creating optical waveguides with integrated gratings, by&#xD;
        developing a single-step writing-process that optimises both of these&#xD;
        steps [3.4].&#xD;
      A technology that has been used to develop sensors by exposing the&#xD;
        gratings to a fluid through an etched window. If the refractive index of&#xD;
        the medium (for example water or antibodies) at the waveguide surface&#xD;
        changes, this can then be sensed with extremely high precision by&#xD;
        monitoring the wavelength that is back-reflected [3.5].&#xD;
      Several gratings can be integrated along one waveguide so that&#xD;
        multiplexed measurements at each grating site may be made, and if each&#xD;
        grating is made sensitive to a different biochemical analyte, then&#xD;
        multiple analytes may be detected simultaneously with extreme&#xD;
        sensitivity [3.6].&#xD;
      All the research on Bragg grating technology was carried out under&#xD;
        several large-scale EPSRC research-grants [G1, G2, G4, G5, G6] while the&#xD;
        underpinning research on the grating inscription was funded via&#xD;
        industrial-funding from Pirelli Cavi SpA [G3].&#xD;
    &#xD;
    This research was carried out between 1994-2008 (FBG), and&#xD;
      1998-2013 (PBG) respectively, involving the following Sir David N.&#xD;
        Payne, (Director ORC). Jon T. Kringlebotn, (Visiting&#xD;
      researcher from Optoplan A/S 1994-1996). Wei H. Loh, (Senior&#xD;

    The process (from research to impact)&#xD;
    The spin-out company Covesion was itself spun out from a parent company,&#xD;
      Stratophase (another&#xD;
      spin-out company of the University started in 2003) in 2009, to better&#xD;
      focus on research and&#xD;
      development of its nonlinear optical materials product line [5.1]. With&#xD;
      fresh venture capital&#xD;
      investment, Covesion developed new Intellectual Property around poling of&#xD;
      magnesium oxide-doped&#xD;
      PPLN for high power applications, technology that had been pioneered&#xD;
      within the ORC. At&#xD;
      its inception Covesion comprised only the two former Stratophase staff&#xD;
      members working on&#xD;
      PPLN. Since then it has created five high-tech jobs and achieved sales&#xD;
      worth &amp;#163;2.1m over three&#xD;
      years, 95 per cent of these sales being to overseas customers [5.2].&#xD;
    Economic impact&#xD;
    Covesion customers include some of the world's most successful companies&#xD;
      and prestigious&#xD;
      research institutes, (including some University-based former PPLN research&#xD;
      groups), which span&#xD;
      the areas of defence, communications, laser manufacturing and medicine. New&#xD;
        business has&#xD;
        therefore been created. The list includes major corporations such as&#xD;
      [text removed for publication].&#xD;
      From recent measurements of the performance of these nonlinear engineered&#xD;
      crystals, where 45W&#xD;
      of green light has been generated from an input near- infrared laser beam,&#xD;
      (reported by Stanford&#xD;
      University, in 2012 [5.3]) it is clear that high-power lasers can now be&#xD;
      built in a far more cost-effective&#xD;
      manner using Covesion components, and such impressive results have led to&#xD;
      significant&#xD;
      patent activity [5.4].&#xD;
    Another area that demonstrates economic impact relates to the use&#xD;
      of these engineered crystals in&#xD;
      laser projection systems for presentations and displays. This laser-based&#xD;
      technology provides&#xD;
      brighter, clearer colours and uses less energy than conventional light&#xD;
      bulb-based units, and&#xD;
      therefore represents an activity that has an impact on the environment&#xD;
      also (management of&#xD;
        energy). Consumer demand in this area is growing rapidly, as&#xD;
      products are marketed for home&#xD;
      cinema, desktop projectors and rear-projection displays. Future&#xD;
      opportunities include pico-projectors&#xD;
      integrated into mobile phones and laptops, as well as use in medical&#xD;
      screening and aero&#xD;
      defence equipment. Covesion has entered into a license agreement and&#xD;
      technology transfer&#xD;
      programme with a leading projector company [text removed for publication].&#xD;
    The final claim under economic impact is that the crystals sold by&#xD;
      Covesion have become essential&#xD;
      parts of new laser systems and applications, which has improved the&#xD;
        performance of existing&#xD;
        businesses. The crystals are integrated into high-end products which&#xD;
      are sold by Covesion&#xD;
      customers, so the leverage effect is considerable, and vital to the&#xD;
      success of these companies.&#xD;
      The company's own analysis of sales of these systems and the volume of&#xD;
      products shipped&#xD;
      suggests that the total worldwide market value of Covesion-enabled&#xD;
      commerce is greater than&#xD;
      US$25m per year (hence $100m since 2009) [5.2]. A ready example concerns&#xD;
      Covesion products&#xD;
      that are used in short-pulse fibre lasers which are sold by at least three&#xD;
      manufacturers [text&#xD;
      removed for publication]. Publicised users to date include Oclaro Inc.,&#xD;
      one of the world's largest&#xD;
      suppliers of optical communications equipment, top universities Harvard&#xD;
      and Stanford and leading&#xD;
      governmental research organisations such as NASA.&#xD;
    Other key applications for Covesion products lay in the area of medical&#xD;
      imaging, where 2-photon&#xD;
      fluorescence microscopy that uses Covesion crystals enables imaging of&#xD;
      living tissue, an area of&#xD;
      immediate concern for real-time medical diagnostics. Covesion have also&#xD;
      played a key role in the&#xD;
      consortium working on the EU-funded CROSS TRAP (Coherently-enhanced Raman&#xD;
      One-beam&#xD;
      Standoff Spectroscopic Tracing of Airborne Pollutants) project [5.5] which&#xD;
      addresses the&#xD;
      development of a novel laser remote sensing technique for probing air at a&#xD;
      distance for hazards&#xD;
      such as biochemicals, bacterial threats and explosive materials.&#xD;
    A final area concerns the impact on society through provision of&#xD;
      essential components in systems&#xD;
      that protect the public and armed forces of several nations &amp;#8212; preventing&#xD;
      future loss of life. Under&#xD;
      UK export licenses, Covesion crystals are used as wavelength conversion&#xD;
      components in laser&#xD;
      countermeasure systems on over 90 commercial aircraft [5.2]. These involve&#xD;
      direction of laser&#xD;
      beams towards an approaching missile, causing it to veer off course. [text&#xD;

    Covesion, the company spun out of the University of Southampton's&#xD;
      research into materials for use&#xD;
      in high-powered lasers, has grown into a multi-million pound business that&#xD;
      has created high-technology&#xD;
      jobs, attracted more than &amp;#163;1 million in US investment and won UK export&#xD;
      orders around&#xD;
      the world. Covesion's nonlinear crystals are used by the world's leading&#xD;
      companies and research&#xD;
      institutes in cutting edge applications that include fibre lasers, medical&#xD;
      imaging, aircraft anti-missile&#xD;
      defences, display projectors and the remote sensing of airborne hazardous&#xD;
      materials. The global&#xD;
      value of Covesion-enabled operations since the company's inception in 2009&#xD;
      is estimated to be in&#xD;
      excess of US$100 million.&#xD;

    Nonlinear optical materials are used to manipulate some of the&#xD;
      fundamental properties of light&#xD;
      (almost invariably laser light) in terms of its wavelength, bandwidth or&#xD;
      spectral content, by the&#xD;
      judicious choice or manipulation of their nonlinear optical coefficients.&#xD;
      The field of nonlinear optical&#xD;
      research has grown rapidly following the invention of the laser in 1960.&#xD;
      Although it may be&#xD;
      comparatively easy to demonstrate laser action in a particular material,&#xD;
      unless the laser&#xD;
      wavelength produced is optimum for the end application, nonlinear optical&#xD;
      techniques are needed&#xD;
      to convert the primary wavelength into the one required, and to do this&#xD;
      with the highest efficiency&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
    One technique for achieving such efficient wavelength conversion is&#xD;
      called `quasi-phase-matching',&#xD;
      which involves the manipulation of a crystal structure by periodically&#xD;
      modifying its internal&#xD;
      crystalline axes at length scales that fall into the few micron range.&#xD;
      Suggested first in the early&#xD;
      1960s, little practical progress was made in the area until the early&#xD;
      1990s, when techniques&#xD;
      emerged to successfully fabricate these engineered crystals with the&#xD;
      correct periodicity and quality.&#xD;
      Three research groups at Sony corporation in Japan, Stanford University in&#xD;
      California, and the&#xD;
      ORC at Southampton, independently developed and refined the fabrication&#xD;
      techniques required,&#xD;
      using lithium niobate crystals as the optimum starting material, to&#xD;
      produce the final product known&#xD;
      as PPLN (periodically poled lithium niobate). In 1994, Southampton&#xD;
      published a key result using a&#xD;
      novel approach which involved periodic structuring using liquid electrodes&#xD;
      [3.1] which produced the&#xD;
      small periods required with excellent fidelity, a result that followed&#xD;
      soon after the first reports from&#xD;
      Sony in 1993 and from Stanford University in 1994. Research followed into&#xD;
      the use of light to&#xD;
      control periodic poling [3.2, G1, G3] and fundamental work on structures&#xD;
      within periodically poled&#xD;
      materials was undertaken via collaborative research [3.3] to further&#xD;
      refine all aspects of the final&#xD;
      material precision and quality.&#xD;
    Progress in the underpinning research extended to the use of periodically&#xD;
      poled materials for&#xD;
      efficient wavelength conversion into the blue (short wavelength), where&#xD;
      450mW of blue light was&#xD;
      generated [3.4] and near-infrared (long wavelength) operation [3.5, G2] as&#xD;
      well as the adoption of&#xD;
      optical waveguide technology which was developed in conjunction with&#xD;
      periodic poling [3.6] all of&#xD;
      which presented further opportunities to expand the range of future&#xD;
      products. In particular, one of&#xD;
      the ORC's important contributions to the technology lay in developing a&#xD;
      simple process for periodic&#xD;
      poling of magnesium oxide doped crystals, which allows them to be used in&#xD;
      high-power&#xD;
      applications and at higher temperatures. Grants G4, G5, G6 cover much of&#xD;
      the subsequent recent&#xD;
      research work, before these activities were spun out via Stratophase and&#xD;
      then Covesion, which&#xD;
      was formed in 2009, initially with just two staff members, to develop a&#xD;
      PPLN business that revolved&#xD;
      around these new-generation magnesium oxide doped crystals. Researchers&#xD;
      who made significant&#xD;
      contributions to this work include:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      Professor David Hanna, who instigated the research into periodic&#xD;
        poling technology, deputy&#xD;
        director of the ORC until his retirement in 2007.&#xD;
      Professor Robert Eason, researching in the ORC 1989- date.&#xD;
      Professor Peter G.R. Smith, joining the ORC in 1994 as Research&#xD;
        Fellow, and founder of&#xD;

    As an internationally leading expert on radiological protection of the
      environment, Copplestone has been appointed to Committee 5 (Environmental
      Protection) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection
      (ICRP). The ICRP helps to prevent cancer and other diseases and effects
      associated with exposure to ionising radiation and to protect the
      environment. The ICRP developed and maintains the International System of
      Radiological Protection used world-wide as the common basis for
      radiological protection standards, legislation, guidelines, programmes and
      practice. Copplestone drafted new recommendations on environmental
      protection which have been translated by the International Atomic Energy
      Agency into the International Basic Safety Standards.
    Being extensively involved in the development of radiological risk
      assessment tools for wildlife, Copplestone is a technical expert for the
      International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) technical cooperation projects
      for Eastern Europe (over the last three years), and has been invited to
      advise on environmental impact assessment from nuclear power plants to
      Malaysia from September 2012. Furthermore, for the last three years
      Copplestone has been involved jointly with the Centre for Ecology and
      Hydrology and Institut de Radioprotection et de S&amp;#251;ret&amp;#233; Nucl&amp;#233;aire in France
      to provide training courses on radiological protection of the environment
      tools and techniques as part of a NERC funded knowledge exchange
      programme. This was extended in 2012 to two training courses in Australia
      at the request of the Australian uranium mining industry who are just
      introducing environmental protection into their assessment requirements.
    Copplestone has also been instrumental in setting up international
      databases on the environmental transfer of radionuclides to wildlife (the
      Wildlife Transfer database) and the biological effects of ionising
      radiation on wildlife (FREDERICA). These databases are currently hosted
      online by Stirling and available for free to any interested parties and
      are being used in compilations of data such as the UNSCEAR (United Nations
      Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation) 2011 biological
      effects on non- human species review and the International Atomic Energy
      Agency's technical report series (in press) on radionuclide transfer to
      wildlife and the International Commission on Radiological Protection
      (ICRP) publication 114 on radionuclide transfer to the ICRPs reference
      animals and plants.
    Copplestone continues to provide technical expert input to national and
      international committees (e.g. Oslo-Paris Convention for the North-East
      Atlantic on behalf of the Department of Energy &amp;amp; Climate Change and
      Defra; IAEA Action Plan on Environmental Protection on behalf of UK; cross
      government department review of the revision of (International and
      European) Basic Safety Standards for radiological protection on behalf of
      the Environment Agency and SEPA).
    Recognised for the expertise in environmental gamma ray spectrometry and
      dosimetry, Tyler was appointed to Dounreay Particle Advisory Group to
      provide expert advice to Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and
      the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (now Dounreay Site Restoration
      Ltd) on the radioactive hot particle issue in 2000 (ending in 2009) -
      resulting in significant improvements in the on/offshore monitoring
      programme for particle abundance important in assessing the hazard and
      risk to human health. This was in response to a request to SEPA by the
      Secretary of State for Scotland and the work fed directly into SEPA's
      regulatory requirements within Dounreay's site licence. In 2009 he was
      appointed to the Particle Recovery Advisory Group (Dounreay), advising
      SEPA and Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd on the on/offshore particle
      recovery programme and strategy, resulting in 1248 particles being
      recovered offshore using Remotely Operated Vehicle technology. In 2011,
      Tyler was appointed to the Dalgety Bay Particle Advisory Group advising
      SEPA on the Ra-226 monitoring and hazard. Now recognised as one of the
      UK's experts on hot particles he has been working with Sellafield Ltd to
      provide advice on the statistical interpretation and monitoring strategies
      to be employed in relation to the hot particles on Cumbrian beaches to
      establish optimal monitoring strategies. The ERL is now well established
      and embedded within the SEPA's R&amp;amp;D framework, supporting key
      regulatory activities and helping SEPA to check for regulatory escape. Our
      work has been critical in providing the evidence base for SEPA to
      interpret the UK's radioactively contaminated land regulations for
      enforcement work at Dalgety Bay.
    In London 2008, as the UK expert Tyler was elected to convene the
      International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) working Group (Nuclear
      Instrumentation Subcommittee 45B-Environmental Radiation Protection) and
      was project leader for the international standards on mobile monitoring
      (IEC 62438) and in-situ gamma spectrometry (IEC 61725) instrumentation
      (with meetings in Paris 2008, Yokohama 2009, Seattle 2010, Las Vegas 2011,
      Karlsruhe 2012, and Moscow 2013). This has resulted in IEC technical
      standards that all manufacturers adhere to in the construction, technical
      specification and environmental tollerances of equipment used for
      environmental radioactivity measurement, monitoring and dosimetry. In 2012
      Tyler was invited to chair National Committee 2 of the British Standards
      Institute (BSI), reviewing ISO and IEC standards for Radiation Protection
      to establish their suitability for the UK and inclusion by the BSI.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The science conducted in environmental radioactivity and radioecology
      ranges from the development and deployment of detection systems to the
      characterisation and implementation of radiological risk assessment tools.
      This has led to impacts in international standards, regulation development
      and regulation enforcement, including: advising the Scottish Environment
      Protection Agency (SEPA) on hot particle hazard, risk, detection and
      recovery; developing the framework for environmental protection through
      the International Commission on Radiological Protection; developing
      standard specifications for the manufacture of environmental monitoring
      equipment for the International Electrotechnical Commission; and providing
      training courses through the International Atomic Energy Agency.

    The Environmental Radioactivity Laboratory (ERL) at the University of
      Stirling is led by Dr David Copplestone and Professor Andrew Tyler. At the
      radioecology end of the ERL's research spectrum, we have developed
      radiological risk assessment methods for humans and wildlife, and assessed
      the impacts of radionuclides released during radioactive waste management
      and disposal, reprocessing, power generation and nuclear accidents. Our
      current research in this area is focused on understanding the ecological
      effects of ionising radiation, and how ecological systems adapt to the
      environmental stress caused by such exposure. Models developed by
      Copplestone of radionuclide transfer and behaviour have been used to
      improve radiological risk assessments. We have also applied genetic and
      molecular techniques to better understand radiological impacts on
      wildlife. We continue to assist the Environment Agency in the development
      of their approach to wildlife risk assessment from ionising radiation. Our
      research into radionuclide transfer parameters to, and on the biological
      effects of ionising radiation on, wildlife is contributing to the
      development of international databases (www.wildlifetransferdatabase.org
      and www.frederica-online.org
      respectively). The scientific understanding derived from his research
      is currently being used in the development of the International Commission
      for Radiological Protection's (ICRP), recommendations for environmental
      protection (he is a member of the ICRP's Committee 5).
    At the physical end of environmental radioactivity research, we
      specialise in laboratory, in-situ and mobile gamma spectrometry,
      environmental dosimetry and the characterisation of radioactive hot
      particles and developed the ISO17025 accredited ERL to demonstrate system
      quality and traceability. The development of real time in-situ and mobile
      gamma detector systems (exploiting new crystal technologies and
      configurations) offer immediate benefits to surveys of contaminated land,
      site characterisation and determining dose rates but is hindered by
      variations in the vertical activity distribution leading to significant
      loss of measurement accuracy. This research exploits characteristics of
      scattered photon radiation using novel spectral algorithms, driven by
      empirical and Monte Carlo approaches, to yield information on the spatial
      (including depth) distribution of specific radionuclides in the
      environment. Importantly, this approach provides the way forward for more
      accurate in-situ estimation of environmental radioactivity concentrations
      to: 1) support baseline surveys for environmental radioactivity; 2) enable
      the detection of hot particles; and 3) provide accurate real-time
      contaminated land assessment. The ERL undertook the first in-situ
      radiometric survey at a national scale to estimate the background
      radionuclide concentrations and contributions to external gamma dose rate
      for Environment Agency, Scottish and Northern Ireland Funding for
      Environmental Research, Food Standards Agency and Department for
      Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. By exploiting airborne remote sensing
      techniques we provided maps of the distribution of radionuclides in
      estuarine environments for better dose characterisation of people and
      wildlife. This was expanded further to establish the dose rates to
      critical groups within the Ribble Estuary in support of the Environment
      Agency's dose assessments, where it was demonstrated that the monitoring
      of Beta and Gamma dose rates for regulatory purposes were inadequate. This
      resulted in revisions in the statutory monitoring programmes taking
      account of our recommendations on correct instrument deployment, use and
      data processing. We have also been working on Radium-226 particle
      dosimetry through skin contact and simulated stomach digestion to all
      human age groups, underpinning the Scottish Environment Protection
      Agency's regulatory activities at Dalgety Bay (UK) and the implementation
      of the contaminated land regulations.

    The impact of the 2001 Mathon and Umerski paper predicting that MgO-based
      systems would exhibit very high MR ratios was immediate. Preliminary
      results were presented at the ICM 2000 Conference in Recife, Brazil, with
      a number of world leading experimentalists in the audience. In addition
      the group were in close communication with experimental groups in Japan
      and the US where high-quality magnetic layer systems were being developed.
      Nevertheless it took three years to manufacture successfully MgO tunnel
      junctions of sufficient quality that a large MR ratio was observed. The
      difficulty arises because the phenomenon is of quantum mechanical origin
      and consequently requires very high quality interfaces. Several
      experimental papers were published during the period 2002-2004, with
      observed MR ratios gradually increasing. In December 2004, the Japanese
      Tsukuba group simultaneously with the US IBM group reported values of
      180%-220% at room temperature, in Nature Materials [3,4]. Both these
      experimental papers cite the predictions of Mathon and Umerski and of
      Butler et al. as motivation and there can be little doubt that the
      results of these theoretical papers both laid the groundwork for success
      and gave experimentalists the impetus required to keep trying until that
      success was achieved.
    Following the experimental success, focus shifted to the creation of a
      commercial product. This required the mass production of MgO-based tunnel
      devices, previously only produced in two world- leading laboratories
      drawing on great experimental expertise. Significant technological
      developments were required in order to do this, principally pioneered by
      the Japanese Tsukuba group and the US IBM group (reviewed in [G] and [H]).
      The first TMR read head reached the market in 2007. Since 2009 all
      manufactured hard disks have been based on this technology. This is
      confirmed by S.S.P. Parkin (head of the research group at IBM and the
      author of reference 4) who states: "The work of Mathon and Umerski
        clearly played an important role in the development of these materials
        and their subsequent widespread application to recording read heads in
        ~2007. All disk drives manufactured since about 2008-2009 use recording
        read heads based on magnetic tunnel junctions." [B]
    Today there are only three major manufacturers of hard disk drives:
      Western Digital, Seagate and Toshiba [A]. In 2008 Western Digital reported
      that "the industry has made the transition to tunnel-junction magneto
        resistive ("TMR") technology for the head reader function. We have
        completed the transition to PMR [Perpendicular Magnetic Recording] and
        TMR in our 2.5-inch products and in the majority of our 3.5-inch
        products" [C]. In 2009 they reported "We have completed the
        transition to PMR and TMR across all product platforms" [D]. An
      example of the use of TMR technology by Toshiba is given in their product
      information for internal notebook hard drives which "use proven state
        of the art....TMR Head Recording technology for increased capacity,
        reliability and performance" [E].
    High-tech companies are naturally somewhat reluctant to disclose the
      detailed operation of their products so it is difficult to trace the
      development of MgO tunnel junctions once they left the confines of
      university laboratories. However, the technological benefit of MgO-based
      read heads to the companies which manufacture hard disks is perhaps most
      clearly demonstrated in the following claim of industrial espionage. The
      American Arbitration Association reported on a 5-year dispute between
      Seagate and Western Digital regarding an employee (Dr Mao) who moved from
      Seagate to Western Digital in September 2006 at a critical time when hard
      disk manufacturers were developing the new MgO-based read heads [F]. The
      report provides the following summary of the background to the case
      (Section A5 on page 4): "Seagate claims that Dr Mao stole Seagate trade
        secrets and confidential information regarding TMR technology and
        provided it to Western Digital, which used trade secrets and
        confidential information to design and manufacture an MgO TMR read head.
        As a result Seagate claims that Western Digital was able to introduce
        products, incorporating an MgO TMR read head, into the market many
        months ahead of when it would have been able to do so without Seagate
        trade secrets and confidential information. Seagate asserts that as a
        result of using stolen Seagate trade secrets and confidential
        information, Western Digital avoided substantial research and
        development costs and made substantial profits." The alleged move of
      Dr Mao is likely to have saved Western Digital many months of research and
      development. In 2011 the American Arbitration Association ruled that for
      this infringement Seagate was entitled to recover $525,000,000 plus
      pre-award interest at 10% per annum. This demonstrates the enormous
      financial importance of the new MgO-based technology.
    It is difficult to say precisely what the increase in hard disk capacity
      is as a result of the MgO-based read head. Firstly, because other factors
      like write density are also important. Secondly. because MgO-based read
      heads are still being developed, with improvements in growth morphology
      leading to greater MR ratios. We can say that in 2005, just before the new
      read heads were introduced, Toshiba introduced a hard drive with a
      record-breaking storage density of 179 Gbit/in2. In 2012 the
      highest density commercially available was about 620Gb/in2
      although work continues towards a 1Tb/in2 drive, demonstrated
      by Seagate with great fanfare in March 2012 [J]. An increase by a factor
      of five to date can certainly be claimed. The difficulty at present
      appears to be with stable recording rather than reading, and for the near
      future the MgO based read head looks likely to remain.
    The role of Mathon and Umerski's work in the emergence of MgO-barrier
      magnetic tunnel junctions is emphasised in the reviews cited at [G] and
      [H]. The 20th Tsukuba Prize was awarded to Drs Yuasa and Suzuki
      (authors of reference 3) for "Giant tunnel magnetoresistance in MgO-based
      magnetic tunnel junctions and its industrial applications". The prize
      citation traces a direct path from the theoretical prediction to the
      industrial application. It emphasises the significance of the industrial
      application and impact on society of TMR technology, stating: "The
        giant TMR effect in MgO MTJs (magnetic-tunnel-junctions) is expected to
        contribute to our society by significantly reducing the power
        consumption of electronics devices and improving the performance and
        security of computers" [I].
    The MR ratio observed in MgO-based systems is now very close to the
      original theoretical prediction of 1000%. The conclusions of the Mathon
      and Umerski theoretical paper, later confirmed experimentally, have
      directly influenced the design of the hard disk reading head commercially
      manufactured since 2008. This has led to increase in hard disk storage
      capacity by more than a factor of five. The original 2001 publication has
      attracted more than 500 citations and, along with that of Butler et
        al., is regarded as a seminal paper in spintronics, one source of
      the explosion of interest in MgO-based systems. Such systems are also the
      basis of magnetic random access memory (MRAM), a new type of non-volatile
      memory, which is being actively developed and may someday replace both
      hard disks and existing random access memory [G, H].
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    The significant increase in hard disk storage capacity in the last few
      years can be in part attributed to theoretical research in Mathematics
      undertaken at City University London. A material or device is said to
      exhibit the property of magnetoresistance if its electrical resistance
      changes when the direction of an external magnetic field is varied. The
      work undertaken at City concluded that devices based on magnesium oxide
      (MgO) would exhibit magnetoresistances very much larger than previously
      observed. In 2004 these conclusions were confirmed experimentally. By 2008
      a new type of disk read head (the device that senses data on a magnetic
      disk) based on this structure was being manufactured commercially,
      enabling a significant increase in hard disk storage capacity. Today all
      computer hard disks use read heads based on this technology in an industry
      with 2012 sales exceeding $28 billion. The increase in hard disk storage
      capacity achieved (from gigabytes to terabytes: 1 terabyte = 1,000
      gigabytes) and the consequent improvement in disk performance for users
      can be partly attributed to the City research.

    Tunneling Magnetoresistance: from theoretical proposal to practical
        application
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Mathematical Sciences</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    The modern day hard disk reading head is the first commercial device to
      use the spin of an electron rather than its charge to control the
      resistance. It exploits the phenomenon of magnetoresistance which is an
      important part of a new multidisciplinary field of study called
      spintronics, which attempts to exploit electron spin in solid state
      devices. The Mathematics Department at City University London has been
      involved in the spintronics field from an early stage. The work was led by
      Professor J Mathon (at City since 1970) with Dr A Umerski (Research
      Assistant at City 1996-2000). The initial research addressed interlayer
      exchange coupling and magnetoresistance effects in metallic and model
      tunneling systems. This work set the foundation for the 2001 publication
      on tunneling magnetoresistance in magnesium oxide (MgO) [1], which is
      regarded as a very significant achievement in the field of spintronics
      with over 800 citations. It should be noted that the calculation of this
      effect posed significant technical problems because it required a highly
      accurate calculation of the tiny tunneling current. This demanded
      significant expertise in spintronics.
    In 1989 a magnetoresistance (MR) of quantum mechanical origin, which
      utilises the spin of an electron, was discovered by Albert Fert and Peter
      Grunberg who later received the 2007 Nobel Prize for their work. This
      discovery was quickly developed commercially. In 1997 IBM brought out a
      hard disk drive (HDD) in which the read head used this effect to sense the
      magnetic `bits' of the disk. By the late 1990s, all hard disk reading
      heads were based on this form of MR. This development is primarily
      responsible for the increase in disk storage density from 0.1 to 100
      Gbit/in2 between 1991 and 2003.
    The efficiency of the modern-day reading head depends on a quantity
      called the magnetoresistance ratio (MR ratio). This can be thought of as
      the maximum percentage change in resistance as the direction of applied
      magnetic field is varied. A reading head with a large MR ratio implies a
      more sensitive device which can read smaller magnetic bits on the hard
      disk, enabling a higher storage density.
    Early metallic-based read heads, used commercially from 1997 until 2005,
      had MR ratios limited to less than 50%. Developments using an amorphous
      insulating barrier produced MR ratios of up to 70% and; this was briefly
      used in Seagate read heads in 2005.
    In 2001 Mathon and Umerski at City [1], simultaneously with a group in
      the US [2], proposed an entirely new system based on a crystalline
      insulator, magnesium oxide (MgO). The underlying physics, based on
      coherent, spin-dependent, quantum electron tunneling through the
      crystalline MgO barrier, is entirely different to the earlier systems. It
      was predicted that the MR ratio of this novel tunneling device could
      exceed 1000%, some 15 times higher than previously achieved. This MR
      effect is called tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and the
      magnetoresistive MgO system is referred to as an MgO tunnel junction.
    Nanostructure devices were successfully produced three years later when
      two world-leading experimental groups, one from Tsukuba in Japan and one
      from IBM Almaden in the US, published separate confirmation of large MR
      ratio in MgO-based systems in the same issue of Nature Materials [3, 4].
      The first such TMR read head reached the market in 2007 and since 2009 all
      manufactured hard disks have been based on this technology (see
      corroborating source B).
    Our theoretical research into coherent tunneling in MgO based tunneling
      junctions continues. Our latest proposal to enhance significantly the MR
      ratio is based on the so-called collimation effect achieved by attaching
      the standard MgO junction to a semiconductor lead. This work is described
      in [5] and [6]. The theoretical expectation is that the MR ratio in
      collimated junctions could be enhanced by a factor of 100.

    Lingas founded Cappella Romana (CR) in 1991. Today he continues to guide&#xD;
      CR as its Artistic Director, the ensemble having since grown into a&#xD;
      non-profit corporation based in the state of Oregon, USA with a current&#xD;
      annual budget of around $300,000 and total expenditure over the REF period&#xD;
      of approximately $1.4 million. CR generated revenue from earned income&#xD;
      (tickets, hiring fees, commercial recordings and licensing), individual&#xD;
      donations (232 households in the 2012/13 financial year) and grants from&#xD;
      governmental agencies and private foundations.&#xD;
    Lingas' research has been fundamental to CR's operation throughout the&#xD;
      period, shaping its concert programming of ancient and modern repertoire,&#xD;
      informing its approaches to vocal performance practice and guiding its&#xD;
      educational and outreach efforts to cultivate Orthodox musical traditions&#xD;
      in both public and ecclesiastical settings. CR has thereby served members&#xD;
      of ethnic communities (Greeks, Russians, etc., whether in their homelands&#xD;
      or in diaspora) and converts to Orthodoxy wishing to preserve and transmit&#xD;
      their musical heritage. At the same time it has promoted widely&#xD;
      experiences and understanding of Orthodox musical traditions amongst&#xD;
      people from other cultural and spiritual backgrounds. These have included&#xD;
      individuals drawn to the history, aesthetics and spiritual qualities of&#xD;
      Eastern Orthodox art and liturgy, as well as devotees of classical and&#xD;
      world genres of vocal ensemble music. Recognising this, Metropolitan&#xD;
      Gerasimos, Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of San Francisco, wrote in a 2011&#xD;
      letter that the ensemble 'is more than just a choral group; they are&#xD;
        ambassadors of our Holy Orthodox faith through music'. Glen W.&#xD;
      Bowersock offered another perspective in The New York Review of Books,&#xD;
      noting that 'The success of the contemporary Cappella Romana chamber&#xD;
        ensemble, ably directed by Alexander Lingas of London, introduces modern&#xD;
        listeners to the sounds that filled the churches of Byzantium no less&#xD;
        than the light of their lamps' (25/9/08). Specific impactful&#xD;
      activity since 2008 includes:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      
Presenting an Annual Subscription Concert Series in Portland, OR&#xD;
          and Seattle, WA, USA. Seasons consist of four or more concerts&#xD;
        performed at least once in each city with total attendance during the&#xD;
        impact period of 16,902. The series gives the ensemble a laboratory to&#xD;
        expand its repertory before a loyal 'home' audience and therefore often&#xD;
        includes world or American premieres. A lecture precedes nearly every&#xD;
        concert and approximately 25% of events feature guest artists. Audience&#xD;
        diversity is reflected in the range of media outlets praising the&#xD;
        performances. Describing a concert of Byzantine Christmas chant, Rod&#xD;
        Parke of The Seattle Gay News (1/15/10) wrote 'the passionate&#xD;
          intensity with which they sang, combined with the exotic nature of&#xD;
          this unfamiliar music, had at times an almost erotic feel. To ears&#xD;
          that gradually opened to the unaccustomed harmonies and pitches, it&#xD;
          was anything but dull.' In The Oregonian (the main&#xD;
        Portland newspaper), James McQuillen noted that during a 2013&#xD;
        performance of Rachmaninoff's Divine Liturgy 'the sensual&#xD;
          appeal was inescapable, and it carried through the evening with&#xD;
          crystal clarity, gentle cadences and phrases as natural as breath'&#xD;
        (12/1/13).&#xD;
      
Touring. CR presented over 50 non-series concerts at locations&#xD;
        including Oxford (2009), London (2009 and 2013), Regensburg (2013),&#xD;
        Boston (2012), Yale University (2009 and 2011), New York (2009 and&#xD;
        2012), San Francisco (2011), Los Angeles (2012), Vancouver, BC (2009)&#xD;
        and Stanford University (2009 and two concerts in 2013) and in Greece&#xD;
        (two concerts each in 2011 and 2013). Listeners have often found CR&#xD;
        performances of previously unheard early Orthodox music revelatory. Upon&#xD;
        hearing medieval Constantinopolitan chant sung at Stanford in the&#xD;
        acoustics of a virtual Hagia Sophia in 2013, Jason Victor Serinus of the&#xD;
        San Francisco Classical Voice wrote 'It is impossible to&#xD;
          describe the experience objectively.... Throwing all caution to the&#xD;
          winds, as it were, the "performance" was the closest to lift-off I&#xD;
          have experienced short of chemically enhanced listening sessions or&#xD;
          the final hours of a seven-days meditation intensive' (1/2/13).&#xD;
      
Broadcasting. Experience and understanding of Orthodox music&#xD;
        was mediated to wider audiences through broadcasts on national, local&#xD;
        and internet media of live and recorded CR performances, as well as&#xD;
        interviews with Lingas and/or other CR colleagues. These included: BBC&#xD;
        Radio 4 (Byzantium Unearthed, a documentary by Bettany Hughes,&#xD;
        2008 and Something Understood, 2013), BBC Radio 3 (The Choir,&#xD;
        2012), Bavarian Radio (2013) and Greek National Radio and Television&#xD;
        (2011 and 2013) in Europe; in the USA on National Public Radio's Weekend&#xD;
          Edition Sunday (segment on Orthodox Easter in 2012, carried on&#xD;
        nearly 600 stations), American Public Media's Performance Today&#xD;
        (2008, 2009, 2010 with 1.3 million listeners on 260 stations), Indiana&#xD;
        Public Media's Harmonia (2009, 2011 and twice in 2012 on over&#xD;
        150 stations) and repeatedly on local stations of the Pacific Northwest.&#xD;
        Interviews have appeared on internet radio services sponsored by the&#xD;
        national churches of American Orthodox jurisdictions (the Orthodox&#xD;
        Christian Network and Ancient Faith Radio), which also feature CR on&#xD;
        music playlists.&#xD;
      
Recording. During the REF impact period CR was featured on 19&#xD;
        CD titles of early and modern vocal music (most of it previously&#xD;
        unrecorded) with total sales of over 19,000 hard copies (most including&#xD;
        substantial booklets featuring texts, translations and notes), plus&#xD;
        downloads and streaming via iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, etc. bringing&#xD;
        US$28,890 in revenue for the digital delivery of 4,094 complete albums&#xD;
        and 77,202 individual tracks. Two titles were marketed under the brand&#xD;
        of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while a third was a compilation&#xD;
        commissioned for the Royal Academy of Arts (RAA) exhibition 'Byzantium&#xD;
        325-1453' (25/10/2008 to 22/3/2009). The RAA also licensed tracks for&#xD;
        the audio guide to its exhibition, the attendance for which was 342,726.&#xD;
      Praise by professional reviewers for CR's discs of unfamiliar&#xD;
        pre-modern music has been noted above, but similar themes appear also in&#xD;
        published reviews of contemporary works, e.g., 'Richard&#xD;
          Toensing...has written a spellbinding Christmas choral concerto in&#xD;
          traditional Orthodox style....stunningly realized by Cappella Romana',&#xD;
        Kyle MacMillan, Denver Post (7/12/2008); and 'The liturgical&#xD;
          music of Greek-America composers is barely known outside the USA...the&#xD;
          addition of this English-texted Liturgy...by Peter Michaelides...is&#xD;
          very welcome indeed. ...Cappella Romana... produce what I imagine to&#xD;
          be an ideal performance of Michaelides's music', Ivan Moody, Gramophone&#xD;
        (October 2010). Fans of CR recordings have communicated their enthusiasm&#xD;
        through both traditional and social media. For example in 2008 science&#xD;
        fiction author Neal Stephenson wrote in a playlist for The New York&#xD;
          Times (17/9/2008) that 'My favorite style of chant is&#xD;
          Byzantine, which I learned about by attending concerts by...Cappella&#xD;
          Romana. The single most powerful piece of music I've heard in recent&#xD;
          years is the "Lament for the Fall of Constantinople." Close your eyes&#xD;
          and you can almost see the Blachernae Walls...'; while a Communion&#xD;
        chant from CR's 2008 recording The Divine Liturgy of St John&#xD;
          Chrysostom... uploaded by a fan to YouTube in 2010 had been viewed&#xD;
        over 60,000 times by 31st July 2013.&#xD;
      
Outreach: Education and Pastoral Work. In addition to&#xD;
        pre-concert talks, CR members regularly offer lectures and workshops on&#xD;
        Orthodox liturgical music open to the general public. The range of&#xD;
        organisations for which Lingas himself has presented such events&#xD;
        includes the Royal Academy of Arts (2008), Stanford University (2009 and&#xD;
        2013), the Canterbury Gregorian Music Society (2010), the Yale Institute&#xD;
        of Sacred Music (2011), the Axion Estin Foundation of New York (2008,&#xD;
        2010 and 2012), the Border Marches Early Music Forum (2012) and the&#xD;
        Hellenic Centre of London (2013, excerpts later broadcast on Hellenic&#xD;
        TV). A participant describing the 2010 Canterbury workshop later wrote:&#xD;
        'Alexander showed that both Gregorian Chant and Eastern Chant were&#xD;
          historic musical forms with a living tradition today. ...Our great&#xD;
          triumph was actually reading and singing the whole Orthodox Saturday&#xD;
          Evening Vespers from start to finish.'&#xD;
    &#xD;
    CR also works directly with Orthodox churches to serve their pastoral&#xD;
      needs. It does so in part by offering its skills and repertories in&#xD;
      worship, singing for services in such locations as London (2009), San&#xD;
      Francisco (2011), St Vladimir's Seminary (Crestwood, NY), Los Angeles&#xD;
      (2012) and Athens (2013). CR's flagship pastoral project is a cooperative&#xD;
      venture with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain&#xD;
      to set its English liturgical texts to traditional Byzantine chant. This&#xD;
      has been supported financially by the A.G. Leventis Foundation, the&#xD;
      National Forum of Greek Orthodox Church Musicians (USA), the Virginia H.&#xD;
      Farah Foundation and the [Anglican-Orthodox] Fellowship of St Alban and&#xD;
      St Sergius. Its first milestone was the release of the 2008 Divine&#xD;
        Liturgy mentioned above, a two-disc recording accompanied by a&#xD;
      40-page booklet with an introduction by Greek Orthodox Archbishop&#xD;
      Gregorios of Thyateira and Great Britain, in which he writes 'I commend&#xD;
        it...with the confidence that it will increase the understanding and&#xD;
        appreciation of both the spirituality of Orthodox worship and the&#xD;
        heights of musical expression to which its chanting aspires.' Its&#xD;
      musical settings were subsequently released as free PDFs in both Byzantine&#xD;
      neumes and Western staff notation, facilitating transmission of the&#xD;
      musical patrimony of Byzantium across notational, linguistic, ethnic and&#xD;
      religious boundaries through their use in liturgical and educational&#xD;
      contexts such as those listed above. In recognition of his scholarly and&#xD;
      pastoral work, Lingas received the highest musical award of the Greek&#xD;
      Orthodox Archdiocese of America in 2010.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Singing has been integral to the practice of Eastern Orthodox&#xD;
      Christianity since antiquity. Its vast medieval repertories of Byzantine&#xD;
      and Slavic plainchant gradually developed into native musical traditions&#xD;
      spread across a geographic arc from Southern Italy to Alaska. Thanks to&#xD;
      emigration and missionary work, forms of Orthodox singing are now also&#xD;
      cultivated in diasporic and missionary communities throughout the world.&#xD;
      Despite the historical importance of Byzantine chant as a sibling to&#xD;
      Gregorian chant, the richness of the historical record and the vibrancy of&#xD;
      contemporary Eastern Christian musical practice, these musical traditions&#xD;
      remain largely unstudied and poorly known in the geographic and cultural&#xD;
      West, in part due to transmission in non-Western languages and forms of&#xD;
      musical notation. Dr Alexander Lingas' research undertaken at City&#xD;
      University London has nourished the global dissemination, understanding&#xD;
      and enjoyment of these music traditions. Building on scholarship that&#xD;
      embraces music philology, performance practice and liturgiology, Lingas'&#xD;
      research has had a broad international societal impact, achieved largely&#xD;
      through his role as Artistic Director of Cappella Romana, an&#xD;
      American-based vocal ensemble with an international reputation for&#xD;
      promoting Eastern Orthodox music. Through encounters with music that was&#xD;
      often previously unknown or inaccessible, listeners from a variety of&#xD;
      cultural and religious backgrounds have discovered the musical traditions&#xD;
      of Eastern Christianity to be as historically significant, artistically&#xD;
      rich and spiritually profound as its better-known masterpieces of&#xD;
      iconography and architecture. This has in turn helped to broaden the&#xD;
      repertories of early and contemporary vocal music in Western Europe and&#xD;
      America to include the musical inheritance of Byzantium and its Slavic&#xD;
      commonwealth. Through his research Lingas has also supported the creation&#xD;
      of new forms of artistic expression and reconstructed older forms of&#xD;
      Eastern Orthodox sacred music; influenced attitudes and perceptions of&#xD;
      musicians, scholars, viewers, readers and listeners on an international&#xD;
      basis; enriched cultural lives and aesthetic experiences in a range of&#xD;
      performance and multimedia contexts; enhanced knowledge and understanding&#xD;
      among different beneficiaries through the close integration of performance&#xD;
      and educational work; and contributed significantly to the preservation,&#xD;
      renewal, interpretation and dissemination of Eastern Orthodox Christian&#xD;
      musical heritage.&#xD;

Evidence of Quality: Favourable published reviews by authoritative&#xD;
      scholars and/or practitioners provide evidence in addition to the review&#xD;
      processes prior to publication. Vasileios Marinis (now of Yale University)&#xD;
      wrote of item 3 in The Medieval Review (2007) that 'Alexander&#xD;
        Lingas is one of the most preeminent musicologists of Medieval Byzantine&#xD;
        chant &amp;#8212; and for good reasons. His essay is a pleasure to read,&#xD;
        informative, and clearly set forth.' Writing for the same journal&#xD;
      (2009/10), C&amp;#233;cile Morrison (CNRS, Paris and Dumbarton Oaks) noted that&#xD;
      among chapters 'presenting their respective complex and wide subject in&#xD;
        as clear a form as possible' this was 'a task achieved&#xD;
        excellently for instance by A. Lingas for Byzantine music.' Charles&#xD;
      Brewer (Florida State University) hailed item 5 in American Record&#xD;
        Review in 2008 as 'the perfect bridge. ...the performances on&#xD;
        this release are among the best I've heard. The annotations are&#xD;
        extensive and informative.... This offers a unique sonic view into the&#xD;
        cross-cultural currents between East and West in the Middle Ages',&#xD;
      before selecting it in a later issue as one of his two contributions to&#xD;
      the magazine's Critics' Choice 2008. A review of item 4 by Fabrice Fitch&#xD;
      (Royal Northern College of Music) in Gramophone (April 2009) was&#xD;
      headed 'A captivating recital as Greek Orthodox chant confronts Western&#xD;
        polyphony' and was highlighted within the issue as a notable&#xD;
      recording (G* designation) with a sidebar interview with Lingas by its&#xD;
      editor. The most recent items (1-2) are companion pieces arising from the&#xD;
      same research. The programme of music on item 2 was commissioned for live&#xD;
      performance in 2006 by the Getty Center to accompany its exhibition 'Holy
        Image, Hallowed Ground: Icons from Sinai' ('sung with strength&#xD;
        and commitment', Los Angeles Times, 12/12/06), performed&#xD;
      first at the Smithsonian Institution ('robust and intriguing music',
      Washington Post, 2/12/06) and later recorded for release by the&#xD;
      Metropolitan Museum of Art. Item 1 was written at the request of&#xD;
      co-curators of the Getty Sinai exhibition (Sharon Gerstel of UCLA and&#xD;
      Robert Nelson of Yale) to be included in a volume of scholarly studies by&#xD;
      eminent contributors that Henry Maguire (John Hopkins University) writing&#xD;
      in Speculum 88.1 (2013) called 'a richly satisfying collection&#xD;
        of essays'.&#xD;

    Since his appointment at City in 2006 (now a Senior Lecturer), Lingas has&#xD;
      covered the full chronological range of Byzantine Christianity musical&#xD;
      inheritance through publications, invited lectures and conference papers&#xD;
      in the fields of (ethno)musicology, Byzantine studies and liturgy. PhD&#xD;
      candidate Spyridon Antonopoulos (enrolled as a student of Lingas in&#xD;
      September 2009) has studied the 15th century Byzantine composer&#xD;
      and theorist Manuel Chrysaphes while remaining active as a professional&#xD;
      singer and teacher of Greek music. The impact of his research was&#xD;
      recognised by an award of &amp;#163;15,561 from the AHRC's Cultural Engagement Fund&#xD;
      in 2013. Lingas and Antonopoulos have extended their research through&#xD;
      collaboration with colleagues based elsewhere. Dr Ioannis Arvanitis of&#xD;
      Athens and John Boyer of Boston, MA, both members of Cappella Romana,&#xD;
      presented scholarship on Byzantine notation and performance practice at&#xD;
      City events in 2009 and 2013. Work on the sonic reconstruction of medieval&#xD;
      worship in Hagia Sophia involving Cappella Romana and Stanford University&#xD;
      Professors Jonathan Abel (Computer Auralisation) and Bissera Pentcheva&#xD;
      (Art History) occurred in California in 2011 and 2013.&#xD;
    The main categories of research findings underpinning the impact are:&#xD;
    &#xD;
      
The texts and music of medieval services from the traditions of&#xD;
          Constantinople and Jerusalem have been reconstructed from primary&#xD;
          sources scattered across a broad geographic and chronological range.&#xD;
        Further study of their original interpretive contexts has informed&#xD;
        impact achieved through selective modern performance. It also has served&#xD;
        the pastoral goal of Eastern Orthodox liturgical renewal by informing&#xD;
        the restorations in worship of the atrophied forms of responsorial and&#xD;
        antiphonal psalmody of the Divine Liturgy of St John Chrysostom.&#xD;
      
The elucidation of relationships between written and oral tradition&#xD;
          in Orthodox Christian (especially Byzantine) singing and the&#xD;
          transnational reception of particular performance practices. This&#xD;
        research supports both the practical revival of pre-modern Orthodox&#xD;
        chant and the creation of materials for pastoral implementation in&#xD;
        received singing traditions (e.g., adaptation of received forms from&#xD;
        Byzantine chant to English text and/or transcriptions into Western staff&#xD;
        notation).&#xD;
      
The illumination of historical points of musical contact between&#xD;
          Eastern and Western Christianity, together with study of the&#xD;
          confessional and cultural politics shaping their popular and scholarly&#xD;
          understandings. Particular musical results of such contacts (e.g.,&#xD;
        Greek Orthodox forms of polyphonic singing) have been edited, performed&#xD;
        and recorded. Contextual study in this area has shaped directly the&#xD;
        programming and performance practice decisions of Cappella Romana (e.g.,&#xD;
        for the CDs The Fall of Constantinople; and Live in Greece:&#xD;
          From Constantinople to California).

    Reach&#xD;
    Plenum was presented on six occasions in Europe and Australia&#xD;
      between 2010 and 2012. As a site-specific public work, each time it was&#xD;
      projected onto different buildings and surfaces the configuration of the&#xD;
      space created a unique visual experience. Festival and event curators&#xD;
      confirm that, over the six performances, the installation was experienced&#xD;
      by over 240,000 people; if website visitors are included, this rises to&#xD;
      well over 300,000.&#xD;
    The organisers of the Lux Scientia festivals &amp;#8212; at Toru&amp;#324; (Poland), Tallinn&#xD;
      (Estonia) and Durham &amp;#8212; reported that a total of 240,000 visitors attended&#xD;
      the three festivals, which also generated over 500 press, online and&#xD;
      TV/radio features. The festivals' combined reach was further extended by&#xD;
      125,980 website visitors and 2,294 views of the Lux Scientia micro-site.&#xD;
      The UK curatorial team, the Artichoke Trust, drew 150,000 visitors to the&#xD;
      Durham Lumiere alone, significantly more than the other two light&#xD;
      festivals combined. Durham County Council estimated that the Lumiere&#xD;
      generated &amp;#163;4.3 million for the local economy.&#xD;
    Figures are unavailable for the Skyway '10 festival appearance (Poland,&#xD;
      2010), but two other Plenum performances saw audiences of just&#xD;
      over 2,000 each: KickArts Contemporary Arts in Cairns, Australia reported&#xD;
      2,100 visitors over June and July 2012; while the Cambridge Music Festival&#xD;
      (November 2012) attracted an audience of around 2,500 over the two-night&#xD;
      projection onto King's College Chapel. Again, the work's online presence&#xD;
      extended the audience, with almost 3,300 Youtube views (in aggregate) of&#xD;
      six videos of Plenum posted at various times between early 2011&#xD;
      and July 2013.&#xD;
    Significance&#xD;
    Festival curators have commented on Plenum's significance and its&#xD;
      reception by audiences. M&amp;#225;rio Caeiro (Toru&amp;#324;), who commissioned the&#xD;
      original 2010 work, described Plenum as `thought provoking and&#xD;
      exciting', noting in particular that it had:&#xD;
    the capacity to manifest most complex facts as proposed by scientific&#xD;
      knowledge through both sensorial and artistic language . . . in a way&#xD;
      which isn't didactic in the worst sense, but truly aesthetic . . . the&#xD;
      work explores the urban form in an idiosyncratic and unexpected way . . .&#xD;
      after some minutes, the whole ecosystem of the artwork becomes patent,&#xD;
      [and] it was frequent to see people absolutely fascinated with the&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
    After the 2012 Cambridge Music Festival, during which King's College&#xD;
      served over two nights as the venue for the light and music projection,&#xD;
      the festival's director said of the installation's visual aspect:&#xD;
    It shows how art can be inspired by science and how science is&#xD;
      fundamentally beautiful, both visually and intellectually. It makes a&#xD;
      nonsense of the supposed `boundary' between the arts and sciences and it&#xD;
      is important that both artists and scientists work to break this down &amp;#8212;&#xD;
      especially in Cambridge, a city renowned for its culture but also for its&#xD;
      `technology cluster' which is sometimes perceived not to engage with local&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
    &#xD;
    &#xD;
    &#xD;
    This particular performance created press interest from sources as&#xD;
      diverse as Gramophone, technology publication Cabume, the&#xD;
      BBC, and student newspapers Varsity and The Cambridge Student.&#xD;
      The latter reported that `many King's students appeared to enjoy the show,&#xD;
      despite not seeming to know what it was about', and included humorous&#xD;
      impressions alongside more considered observations of the artwork: `One&#xD;
      third year medic described the show as, "impressive, weirdly hypnotic and&#xD;
      seriously atmospheric in the fog" . . . Another third year medic said she&#xD;
      felt she "was going to be abducted if she stared at it too long".'&#xD;
    The installation's Australian curator reacted positively to the work's&#xD;
      seamless blending of visuals and music:&#xD;
    The combination of the sounds and the visual made that I felt I was&#xD;
      WITHIN the work; there were no boundaries between sound, visual and&#xD;
      myself, it was an experience of being entirely "present", all "thought"&#xD;
      becoming "non-thought" . . . I found the work utterly inspiring.&#xD;
    Longevity&#xD;
    Plenum is now migrating from public art to concert-hall&#xD;
      performance, in which the visuals will be projected inside the buildings&#xD;
      rather than onto exteriors. In this form, it has been booked for three&#xD;
      separate music festival appearances during 2013/14: the Huddersfield&#xD;
      Contemporary Music Festival (November 2013), Frome Festival (July 2014)&#xD;
      and Kings Place Festival, London (January 2014). This shift demonstrates&#xD;
      that Plenum has succeeded as a customisable piece, capable of&#xD;
      presentation in a wide range of environments and able to reach different&#xD;
      audiences.&#xD;
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>&#xD;
    Plenum is an installation conceived by Simeon Nelson in 2010 as a&#xD;
      collaborative art-music artwork. It was performed six times between 2010&#xD;
      and 2013 at sound and light festivals in Poland, Estonia and the UK, at&#xD;
      the Cambridge Music Festival, and at an Australian contemporary arts&#xD;
      venue. Audiences totalling over 240,000 saw the work, with website&#xD;
      visitors extending its reach to over 300,000; the Durham Lumiere alone, of&#xD;
      which Plenum formed an integral element, created an estimated &amp;#163;4.3&#xD;
      million for the local economy. Festival and arts curators have described Plenum&#xD;
      as `thought provoking' and `inspiring'.&#xD;

    Simeon Nelson, professor of sculpture, proposed Plenum, a light&#xD;
      and sound installation, in 2010. The work was completed that year in&#xD;
      collaboration with composer Rob Godman (Music department) and&#xD;
      artist/programmer Nick Rothwell; the entire work underwent substantial&#xD;
      revision in 2011.&#xD;
    Plenum, a computer-generated real-time architectural light&#xD;
      projection, was a contributing work to a multi-city series of exhibitions,&#xD;
      seminars and lectures, entitled `Lux Scientia', that linked European&#xD;
      academics, scientists and artists in a discourse about the relationships&#xD;
      between art, science and belief. Informed by Nelson's conversations with&#xD;
      Durham University astrophysicist and theologian Revd Professor David&#xD;
      Wilkinson, Plenum's significance lies in its combination of&#xD;
      cosmology and complexity theory, a new scientific paradigm that sees the&#xD;
      cosmos as comprehensible at all scales and contexts. People's engagement&#xD;
      with the material world is arguably masked by the limitations of their&#xD;
      senses and habits of thinking. The aim of the project was to show the&#xD;
      possibility on an underlying order at both micro and macro-cosmic scales.&#xD;
    The work takes the form of a projected grid of dots. This is the first&#xD;
      instance of the application of the grid, much used in twentieth-century&#xD;
      art, to the transformation of structures in science used in a public&#xD;
      rather than a gallery context. The originality of the work is its&#xD;
      depiction of states of matter at simultaneously very small and very large&#xD;
      scales, linking the vast distances between stars with the vast emptiness&#xD;
      inside atoms. The drawings for Plenum were based on the&#xD;
      illustrations of crystal lattices found in modern physics textbooks. A&#xD;
      perfect crystalline grid of dots underpins the work's projection cycle:&#xD;
      random dots begin to appear within the projection, forcing the surrounding&#xD;
      dots apart; the top layers of the grid begin to disintegrate into what&#xD;
      appears to be a gaseous state, shooting off in seemingly random&#xD;
      trajectories. Thus the projection runs a full sequence from a graphic&#xD;
      representation of a frozen state of absolute order through increasing&#xD;
      entropy to a state of complete chaos.&#xD;
    The structure of Plenum's musical component is shaped by the same&#xD;
      algorithm that determined the position of the position and the trajectory&#xD;
      of the projected dots. Image and sound came together in a public forum to&#xD;
      articulate in visual and sonic form the passage of states of matter and&#xD;
      our ability to perceive them.&#xD;
    Plenum was presented at three festivals in 2011 (in Toru&amp;#324;, Poland;&#xD;
      Tallinn, Estonia; and Durham, UK) and twice in 2012 (Cambridge Music&#xD;
      Festival and in Australia); its earliest incarnation appeared at Toru&amp;#324;'s&#xD;
      Skyway '10 light festival (2010). The art-science dialogue that lay at the&#xD;
      heart of Plenum's conception continued during the three Lux&#xD;
      Scientia festivals (2011), which included symposia held at each event,&#xD;
      with contributions from scientists, artists, curators and commissioners.&#xD;
      These colloquia drew upon the expertise of cosmologists, psychologists,&#xD;
      artists and musicians to explore some of the ways in which art and science&#xD;
      articulated belief, specifically the ways in which the narratives of&#xD;
      science and art &amp;#8212; each with their own subjective world-views and&#xD;
      presuppositions &amp;#8212; can collectively contribute to a fuller picture of&#xD;
      reality. The discussions culminated in an EU-funded symposium entitled&#xD;
      `The Future of European Collaboration' in London.&#xD;

    The research described above has been used to inform national and
      international political, professional and public debate about the risks of
      MDMA use. It has provided key evidence influencing UK and US governmental
      debate about the drug's legalisation and allowed medical professionals and
      specialist information websites to provide better-evidenced and more
      accurate advice to groups, including pregnant women and recreational drug
      users. Contributions to media discourse have supported both the delivery
      of more accurate media coverage of issues relating to the effects of the
      drug and increased public awareness of those issues.
    Informing US policy makers, health professionals, and public about the
        potential harmful effects of MDMA.
    Parrott and Turner's publications from 1998 through to 2004 feature on
      the US government's National Institute of Health, National Institute
        on Drug Abuse (NIDA) website. This site provides information
      resources that are authoritative, respected and used by a wide range of US
      policy makers, health professionals, drug users and members of the US
      public as core information on the potential harmful effects of drugs on
      adult functioning. Four UEL-authored papers, including [1], are cited on
      the website as key pieces of research evidence for the harmful effects of
      MDMA [a].
    Informing UK government debate about the legal classification of MDMA.
    In the UK the same work, outlining the potential neurological and
      psychological risks of MDMA use, has informed government debate and
      decisions relating to the legal classification of MDMA, and specifically
      to its status as a Class A versus Class B drug. In 2008, Parrott, Turner,
      Soar, and Milani made invited contributions to the 2009 Home Office Advisory
        Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) review of MDMA, which cites
      [b]. Parrott was one of only eight expert witnesses called to give oral
      evidence; Turner, Soar and Milani also provided written evidence on the
      negative effects of the drug. Papers published by the UEL group &amp;#8212;
      including [1] and [3] &amp;#8212; are referenced frequently in the report [b].
      Whilst the ACMD report recommended that MDMA be re-classified to Class B,
      Home Office Ministers in fact rejected this recommendation, a decision
      informed in part by the work of the UEL team, which evidences the
      long-term negative effects of MDMA on memory and mood.
    Engaging audiences with drug legalisation debates: contributions to
        media discourse
    Parrott's subsequent extensive engagement in public debate with the Chair
      of ACMD (David Nutt) about the use of evidence, and conclusions of the
      ACMD report [c], ensured that the research not only influenced policy, but
      also enhanced public awareness and understanding of some of the most
      important issues relating to the use of the drug. In September 2012,
      Parrott took part in Channel 4 television's "Drugs Live" programme, in
      which he debated the potential negative effects of MDMA on adults with
      David Nutt and Val Curran. Parrott made a significant contribution to the
      programme in proposing the arguments for the potential `side-effects' of
      MDMA if used in therapy. In so doing, he referred to studies undertaken at
      UEL (both by him whilst he was here and, subsequently, by the rest of the
      team) that have reported long-term negative effects on memory and mood.
      Moore was also an invited member of the expert audience for that
      programme, which reached a peak audience of more than 2 million viewers
      [d]. A You Tube link to the programme had received in excess of 5,000
      views in July 2013.
    The reach of these impacts on UK public awareness of, and engagement
      with, issues pertaining to the drug legalisation debate was extended by
      subsequent contributions to international public and media discourses on
      that topic, with Parrott, Turner and Moore all contributing to media
      debates engaging both UK and overseas audiences. On 28 September 2012, for
      example, Moore contributed to a debate with Val Curran about whether the
      Drugs Live programme had given a sufficiently clear message about the
      negative effects of MDMA generally and about the importance, more
      specifically, of ensuring that young women recognise the danger that its
      use might pose to unborn babies dangers before they are aware of their
      pregnancy. The debate was broadcast on the Voice of Russia UK, the Russian
      government's international radio broadcasting service. A You Tube link to
      the programme had been accessed more than 600 times by July 2013 [e].
    Raising awareness among international public audiences about the
        dangers of MDMA use in early pregnancy.
    Since their publication in 2012, findings from the DAISY study &amp;#8212; the
      first in the world to report the effects of MDMA on motor and cognitive
      functioning in human infants &amp;#8212; have likewise been widely covered by
      popular and news media [f]. They were, moreover, also reported in detail
      on leading pregnancy information websites in the UK and USA [e.g. g].
      Prior to the publication of the research findings, such sites gave only
      very generic advice against illicit drug use during pregnancy, and had no
      firm evidence of the negative effects of MDMA specifically on the
      long-term development of babies. One of the most popular UK pregnancy
      websites, BabyCentre UK, has since updated their drug advice pages to make
      reference to the DAISY study's findings about the effects of MDMA on
      infant motor function [g]. The site, which is visited millions of times
      each month by pregnant women or those planning pregnancies, refers
      specifically to a paper from the study [5].
    Improving understanding among medical and health professionals
    As well as being used to inform general public audiences, the DAISY
      findings were widely reported and discussed on medical websites in the UK
      and US. Between 28 February and 2 March 2012, that coverage included
      discussion of the results published in [5] on US News' HealthDay
      site, MedicineNet.com, and DrugRehab.us; the article also received
      a particularly high number of views on Medical News Today, where
      it was listed as the `editor's choice' [h].
    Publications by UEL researchers have led to invitations for them to share
      their research findings and the expert knowledge accruing from their work
      with a wide range of medical health professionals, through contributions
      to live events. Parrott's expertise remains much in demand among medical
      professional groups, and he continues to draw on evidence gathered during
      his time at UEL in meeting that demand. Throughout the period of the DAISY
      project &amp;#8212; which ran up to and through 2008 &amp;#8212; Moore accepted numerous
      invitations to present lectures and workshops on the study for audiences
      of paediatricians and health professionals, including at the British
      Association for Community Child Health. These led to an invitation to
      provide a chapter (published in 2011) on the potential pre-natal effects
      of MDMA for a book in the prestigious Clinics in Developmental Medicine
      series (McKeith) [i]. This provided access to data on the potential
      harmful effects of MDMA, including preliminary data from the Daisy study,
      for professionals from other disciplines, particularly including
      paediatricians, neurologists and general practitioners,
    Raising awareness among drug users of the potential harmful effects of
        MDMA
    The UEL team's work on MDMA has featured regularly, not just on TV news
      (e.g. ITV News, Channel 4 News and the BBC's World Service) and in the
      national press, but on independent websites set up to inform drug users
      [j]. It has also been presented at the Club Health Conference in Ibiza
      (2008) and Prague (2011), where the research results were used to inform a
      non-academic audience of policy-makers, law enforcement agencies, a wide
      range of health professionals, nightclub owners and clubbers. Work has
      also been presented at the National Drug Treatment Conference to policy
      makers, clinicians and service users.
    </ImpactDetails><ImpactSummary>
    Research conducted by UEL's Drugs and Addictive Behaviours Research Group
      (DAB) and the UEL Institute for Research in Child Development (IRCD) from
      1990-2012 has provided key information about the neuro-psychological risks
      of the use of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy).This information has been used by
      the US and UK governments, medical professionals and public information
      organisations. The research was included in the UK government Advisory
        Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD, 2009) review of MDMA effects
      and informed government and public debate on the legal classification of
      MDMA. It has also supported associated debates around the potential
      harmful effects of MDMA. Subsequent media and public engagement with those
      debates has contributed to increased public awareness of the effects and
      risks of MDMA and engaged new audiences with important social and
      scientific issues. More recent research has informed parents and medical
      practitioners about the potential harmful effects of MDMA on specific
      aspects of infant functioning when taken during pregnancy.

      the neuro-psychological functioning of adults and babies
    </Title><UKLocation/><UKRegion/><UOA>Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience</UOA><UnderpinningResearch>
    The psycho-biological effects of MDMA (ecstasy), particularly in terms of
      its `recreational' use and effects on the cognition and mood of adult
      users, have been studied at UEL since 1990. Research in this area was
      instigated by Professor Andrew Parrott (at UEL until 2004; now Swansea)
      and has been continued by members of the Drugs and Addictive
        Behaviours group (DAB), including Dr Lynne Dawkins (2005-current),
      Dr John Turner (1995-current), and Dr Kirstie Soar (2003-current). More
      recently Professor Derek Moore (UEL 1995-current) and Dr Julia Goodwin
      (1997-2008, now NPEU, Oxford) from the UEL Institute for Research in
        Child Development (IRCD) have also worked collaboratively with
      Turner and Parrott, together with Singer (Case Western Reserve
      University), to explore the effects of MDMA exposure in pregnancy on
      infant development.
    Parrott, Turner and Soar have published numerous widely-cited empirical
      and review papers, including some of the first papers to demonstrate
      impaired memory functioning in young recreational ecstasy (MDMA) users
      compared with aged-matched controls [e.g. 1]. The group led the way in
      examining both the immediate and longer-term effects of MDMA use on
      cohorts of young recreational drug users in typical `rave' conditions.
      These studies suggested that long-term ecstasy users were significantly
      impaired on immediate and delayed word recall [1]. The team has continued
      to investigate the nature of these cognitive/ memory impairments, using a
      variety of cognitive tasks to measure executive planning, vigilance,
      psychomotor performance and specific aspects of memory [2, 3]. The work
      has been published in high impact psychopharmacology journals, and is
      influential and highly cited in the field.
    In 2002, an approach made by Professor Singer of Case Western Reserve
      University (USA) culminated in the collaborative (UEL / Case Western
      Reserve) Drugs And Infancy Study (DAISY). Co-led at UEL by Moore
      and Parrott with Turner and Goodwin, the DAISY project was the first, and
      to-date only, prospective study to investigate the impact of MDMA use
      during pregnancy on infant development. Through prospective interviews
      with pregnant poly-drug users, the study ascertained likely patterns of
      poly-drug exposure across trimesters, showing that infants are most likely
      to be exposed to MDMA in the first trimester (not later) and that cannabis
      and tobacco use are likely to feature alongside MDMA use [4]. The key
      post-natal effect on human infants was shown to be differences in the
      quality of motor functioning at four months in infants exposed to MDMA,
      compared to other polydrug-exposed babies [5], a finding that corresponds
      with the serotonin-related effects found in animals exposed in utero. The
      DAISY study also went on to show that these negative motor effects are
      still evident through to 12 months of age in MDMA-exposed babies [6].
    The work also suggested that MDMA may contribute to differential sex
      ratios; women who took part in the study were more likely to give birth to
      male than female babies [5]. These unprecedented findings have been
      published in Psychopharmacology, Teratology and Paediatric journals, and
      have reached a wide audience of psychology, psychiatry, medical
      professionals, as well as the wider public.

    In 2010 Organ of Corti won the `PRS for Music Foundation's New&#xD;
      Music Award' [Section: 5, Ref: 1]&#xD;
      with a unanimous vote from the judges who were `impressed by the quiet&#xD;
      purity of the idea...'&#xD;
      [Section: 5, Ref: 2]. Over the summer of 2011, Organ of Corti&#xD;
      toured England, being hosted by&#xD;
      organisations including the City of London Festival, Lake District Summer&#xD;
      Music Festival, Costwold&#xD;
      Water Park's summer events and Worcester Music and wider summer festivals&#xD;
      [Section: 5, Ref: 3].&#xD;
      At each location a series of accompanying events were offered which&#xD;
      extended the reach of the&#xD;
      structure itself. [Section: 5, Ref: 4]&#xD;
    Grants&#xD;
    Following an initial research project funded by the Wellcome Trust&#xD;
      (&amp;#163;30,000) [Section: 5, Ref:9]&#xD;
      Organ of Corti was made possible by the &amp;#163;50,000 commission from the&#xD;
      `PRS for Music&#xD;
      Foundation's New Music Award'. Arts Council England funded a further&#xD;
      &amp;#163;10,000 to widen the&#xD;
      impact of the tour by enabling the tour to stay longer at each location.&#xD;
      &amp;#163;6101.80 was also received&#xD;
      from the Escalator Fund, administered by University College Falmouth as&#xD;
      well as &amp;#163;490 from&#xD;
      Worcester City Council. Sustrans adopted Organ of Corti as part of&#xD;
      the ongoing public engagement&#xD;
      project Tranquillity is a State of Mind, and contributed to the&#xD;
      costs of hosting Organ of Corti in&#xD;
      Worcester. Through the project we made strong links with other local&#xD;
      businesses that provided in-kind&#xD;
      support in the form of time, resources, marketing and access to existing&#xD;
      audiences to make&#xD;
      the project a success. [Section: 5, Ref:9]&#xD;
    Following the Wellcome Trust funded Tranquility is a State of Mind&#xD;
      research project, liminal worked&#xD;
      with Sustrans to commission Worcester Artist Rob Colbourne to undertake&#xD;
      his project 20ft to an&#xD;
        Inch' with a separate &amp;#163;30,000 award from the Arts Council [Section:&#xD;
      5, Ref: 9]. The project formed&#xD;
      a key element of the outreach for Organ of Corti and engaged 300&#xD;
      children and adults from local&#xD;
      schools and community groups in Worcester.&#xD;
    Audience&#xD;
    The live audience to the 4 tour locations and the accompanying events was&#xD;
      8725, the wider&#xD;
      audience reached through online, print and broadcast media during the tour&#xD;
      was estimated at over&#xD;
      403,000 [Section: 5, Ref: 6]. Following the tour Organ of Corti&#xD;
      was installed at Poltimore House for&#xD;
      a period of 2 years&#xD;
    Media Coverage&#xD;
    The PRS for Music Foundations New Music Award received extensive media&#xD;
      coverage during the&#xD;
      short-listing process and following Organ of Corti's win in&#xD;
      September 2010. The ceremony itself&#xD;
      was reported widely in the International press. SkyArts subsequently made&#xD;
      a documentary about&#xD;
      the New Music Award and its three winners [Section: 5, Ref: 7]. Organ&#xD;
        of Corti later featured in the&#xD;
      BBC TV programme `Bang Goes the Theory' [Section: 5, Ref:13]. The project&#xD;
      featured in local,&#xD;
      national and international radio, newspapers and magazines, both online&#xD;
      and in print, covering&#xD;
      culture, science, art, architecture and music during the period of the&#xD;
      tour [Section: 5, Ref: 7]. Since&#xD;
      the tour it has received further international coverage in specialist&#xD;
      magazines covering business,&#xD;
      architecture and music [Section: 5, Ref: 18-22].&#xD;
    Research Networks and Policy&#xD;
    Following the original research project funded by the Wellcome Trust &amp;#8212; Tranquillity&#xD;
        is a state of&#xD;
        mind which resulted in Organ of Corti, David Prior was&#xD;
      invited by Dr Tjeerd Andringa to conduct a&#xD;
      workshop as part of the Groningen University 2010 research project looking&#xD;
      at ways to mitigate the&#xD;
      sound annoyance problems in Assen [Section: 5, Ref: 8]. The aim of the&#xD;
      research project was to&#xD;
      contribute to changes in the city of Assen's sound policy. Liminal also&#xD;
      presented Organ of Corti to&#xD;
      the COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Network &amp;#8212; TDU&#xD;
      Action TD0804 as&#xD;
      an exemplar case-study in their project that is working towards preparing&#xD;
      guidance on assessing&#xD;
      and improving Soundscape design in planning policy in response to the EU&#xD;
      Noise Directive&#xD;
      [Section: 5, Ref: 6]. Organ of Corti was also exhibited as part of&#xD;
      the Noise Abatements exhibition&#xD;
      promoting positive soundscapes in collaboration with Brighton and Hove&#xD;
      city council and has been&#xD;
      exhibited as part of the TDU Action workshop as part of the AIA-DAGA&#xD;
      20132028Conference on&#xD;
      Acoustics, Merano, Italy, in March 2013 [Section: 5, Ref: 7].&#xD;
    Awards&#xD;
    The project's contribution to new ways of thinking about music was&#xD;
      recognised by the PRS New&#xD;
      Music Award, who funded the project. The piece was also shortlisted for&#xD;
      the Phonurgia Nova&#xD;
      sound art award (2011) [Section: 5, Ref: 12]. The Wellcome Trust,&#xD;
      recognised the project's&#xD;
      contribution to the debate around sound, health and wellbeing, funding&#xD;
      early research for the&#xD;
      project. The piece won the John Connell Innovation Award (2011) for&#xD;
      contribution to acoustics and&#xD;
      the environment [Section: 5, Ref: 10]. Organ of Corti pioneers the&#xD;
      use of sonic crystal arrays in art,&#xD;
      an innovation recognized by an honorary mention at Prix Ars Electronica&#xD;
      2012 [Section: 5, Ref:&#xD;
      11]. In July 2013, following public consultation, planning permission was&#xD;
      granted for a permanent&#xD;
      version of Organ of Corti &amp;#8212; called Cochlea Unwound on the&#xD;
      banks of the river Severn. [Section:&#xD;

    Organ of Corti is an experimental instrument by David Prior&#xD;
      (Associate Prof. Falmouth University)&#xD;
      and Frances Crow that filters the sound around it into new listening&#xD;
      experiences. Winner of the&#xD;
      `Performing Rights Society (PRS) for Music Foundation's New Music Award'&#xD;
      in 2010, Organ of&#xD;
        Corti toured England in the summer of 2011. The piece was presented&#xD;
      in partnership with&#xD;
      nationally recognised regional music festivals reaching an estimated&#xD;
      audience of over 400,000&#xD;
      during its tour, both live and via National and International media&#xD;
      coverage [Section: 5, Ref:14-23].&#xD;
    Organ of Corti has received recognition from a number of&#xD;
      International awards within the&#xD;
      disciplines of new music, acoustics and technology [Section: 5, Ref&#xD;

      October 2011&#xD;
      "The Organ of Corti has provoked much interest from Poltimore visitors.&#xD;
        There is a layer of mystery&#xD;
        to it which, through learning more about it, will enable Poltimore House&#xD;
        volunteers to provide better&#xD;
        guidance to its impact on the way we hear the Poltimore landscape &amp;#8212; and&#xD;
        in particular the way it&#xD;
        encourages us to listen. Visually of course it is stunning, and has&#xD;
        transformed that area of the great&#xD;
        lawn behind the house, shimmering in the sunshine, reflecting the trees&#xD;
        around and the changing&#xD;
        patterns of clouds. It mediates sound for visitors, but equally mediates&#xD;
        the way we see the familiar&#xD;
        landscape of lawn, trees and people".&#xD;

    In 2008, liminal (architect Frances Crow and David Prior)&#xD;
      [Section 3, Ref: 1] were awarded a grant&#xD;
      from the Wellcome Trust for their research project Tranquillity is a&#xD;
        State of Mind: Listening Aids for&#xD;
        a Listening Impaired Society [Section 3: Ref 2 &amp;amp; 3]. Working in&#xD;
      partnership with Sustrans, the&#xD;
      sustainable transport charity, they brought together a research team&#xD;
      comprising two acousticians,&#xD;
      a computational neuroscientist, and a clinical audiologist in order to&#xD;
      develop a concept for a&#xD;
      `listening aid': a device that rather than correcting an impairment in&#xD;
      hearing, might facilitate&#xD;
      contemplation on the act of listening itself. Organ of Corti&#xD;
      (then named The Cochlea Unwound)&#xD;
      was the outcome of this process, an experimental instrument that&#xD;
      contributes to a dialogue on the&#xD;
      relationship between sound, health and wellbeing by means of an&#xD;
      artistic-acoustic intervention in to&#xD;
      a natural environment, encouraging reflexive listening.&#xD;
    Organ of Corti filters the sounds around it into new listening&#xD;
      experiences. The piece utilises a&#xD;
      class of metamaterial referred to as a `Sonic Crystal'; a physical object&#xD;
      comprised of periodically&#xD;
      spaced acoustic scattering elements that alter the behaviour of a sound&#xD;
      wave as it passes through&#xD;
      it. Designed in collaboration with the Acoustics Research Group at the&#xD;
      Open University, lead by&#xD;
      Professor Keith Attenborough, Organ of Corti is an array of 96,&#xD;
      4-metre cylinders that form an&#xD;
      enveloping structure through which the visitors moves. Sound from the&#xD;
      surrounding environment&#xD;
      passes through the array of cylinders and is sculpted by the structure,&#xD;
      creating changing&#xD;
      perceptions of familiar sounds. Acoustics research into the use of sonic&#xD;
      crystals is still in its&#xD;
      infancy Organ of Corti became a vehicle through which the Open&#xD;
      University team could expand&#xD;
      their ongoing research into this emerging technology. [Section: 3, Ref: 4]&#xD;
    Organ of Corti is particularly unusual in the contribution to&#xD;
      Sound Art in that it makes to this history&#xD;
      in that it does not make any sound of its own, but rather, 2028it attempts&#xD;
      to draw our attention to the&#xD;
      sounds already present by framing them in a new way. The piece builds on&#xD;
      the pioneering work if&#xD;
      Alvin Lucier, who through numerous pieces, establishes a complex interplay&#xD;
      between the material&#xD;
      of the sounds produced and the acoustic context of the place in which they&#xD;
      are heard. Similarly,&#xD;
      some of the installation work of Michael Asher sought to change the&#xD;
      acoustic behaviour of existing&#xD;
      spaces. However, with its specific focus on rematerializing sound and&#xD;
      dehabituating the listener's&#xD;
      relationship to it, Organ of Corti bears just as close a&#xD;
      relationship to the light sculptures of James&#xD;
      Turrell and the environmental philosophy of Gernot Bohme or the&#xD;
      anthropology of Tim Ingold. The&#xD;
      research has contributed to further impact within the wider academic&#xD;
      disciplines of acoustics,&#xD;
      music and sound art, being cited in a number of peer reviewed papers and a&#xD;
      book [Section: 3 Ref&#xD;
      5-10].&#xD;
